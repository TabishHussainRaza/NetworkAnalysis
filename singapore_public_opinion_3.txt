Singapore celebrated its 58th year of independence last week. Located in maritime Southeast Asia, it is a unique island nation that combines both city-state and country statuses. It covers a total land area of 734.3 square KM. As of mid-2023, the population stands at an estimated around 6.2 Million. Economic and energy consumption trends closely follow each other in Singapore. According to Singapore’s Energy Market Authority (EMA), the nation witnessed a 5.3% increase in electricity consumption from 50.8 TWh in 2020 to 53.5 TWh in 2021. This surge corresponded with the growth in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which expanded from SGD 461.06 billion in 2020 to SGD 496.16 billion in 2021.Nuclear Energy Development in SingaporeEMA, the regulator of Singapore’s electricity and natural gas industries, also serves as the Power System Operator, suggests that nuclear energy could supply about 10% of the nation's energy needs, supporting the power sector's goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. To better understand and plan for Singapore's energy future, the EMA formed the Energy 2050 Committee. This diverse team comprises industry, academic, and governmental experts. Their mission is to identify long-term energy trends and propose strategic approaches for the coming decades. This move is in line with the recent pledge by Singapore's Finance Minister to target net-zero emissions by around 2050, a significant commitment given that the power sector is responsible for nearly 40% of the country's carbon emissions. Anticipating a rise in electricity demand, the committee employed scenario-based analysis in its report to highlight possible pathways for a carbon-neutral power sector by 2050.The debate over Singapore's potential adoption of nuclear energy isn't new. Its origins can be traced back to the oil crises of 1973 and 1979. Given its status as a global oil and refining centre without domestic sources, Singapore has always been highly responsive to oil price shifts. Consequently, the allure of energy independence has been strong. This prompted the Public Utilities Board (PUB) in 1973 to initiate training for technical staff in preparation for a potential “nuclear age” for Singapore.Furthermore, The pre-feasibility of a 2010 study by the Ministry of Trade and Industry that the conversation took a nuanced turn. This investigation concluded that nuclear energy was still not a fit for SingaporeSingaporean Perceptions of Nuclear EnergyIn 2010, a preliminary study identified multiple concerns to the adoption of nuclear energy in Singapore such as:Safety Concerns: Susceptibility of nuclear accidents, fear of terrorist attacks, radiation concernsSpace: With an area of just about 728.3 km², Singapore faces difficulties in housing Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs), especially given the typical 30km radius safety zone they demandLack of Expertise: Before 2010, Singapore had not initiated any formal educational programs or training in nuclear technologyRegional Development: At that time, the ASEAN community did not have clear strategies or positions regarding nuclear powerFast forward to 2021, Nuclear Business Platform (NBP) conducted a survey focused on the youth, aged 19-28, as they play a crucial role in shaping Singapore's energy future. The survey had a dual purpose: understanding their views on nuclear energy's viability in Singapore and evaluating their knowledge about the topic in the local context. Analysing responses from 620 participants, we uncovered insightful data.Surprisingly, 59.4% of participants were receptive to the inclusion of nuclear energy in Singapore's power landscape. However, a major deterrent for many was misunderstandings about radiation threats posed by nuclear facilities. An overwhelming 92.6% believed that educational bodies, media outlets, and the government had not provided sufficient information on nuclear energy, underscoring a gap in both media coverage and educational content on the matter.

Nuclear Technology Options for SingaporeIn the quest to address its energy needs, Singapore, a densely populated island city-state with 6.2 million residents, could find promising solutions in Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and Floating Nuclear Power Plants (FNPPs). Lacking indigenous energy resources, these innovative nuclear technologies could offer significant benefits.Case in point, the world's first floating nuclear power plant (FNPP), 'Akademik Lomonosov,' commenced commercial operations in May 2020. As reported by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), this FNPP houses two 35 MW reactors that produce energy efficiently. Similarly, SMRs, which are notably smaller than conventional nuclear reactors, have the unique advantage of factory-assembled systems and components. This feature allows for their easy transport and installation. An example of this can be found in Russia, where two 35 MW SMRs are in operation in Pevek, an Arctic port town. Housed on a 144-meter long vessel, this plant was commissioned in 2020.SMRs and FNPPs are capturing global interest, especially in smaller or land-scarce countries like Singapore. Their compact size facilitates modular construction, wherein main components are manufactured in factories and then assembled on-site. This approach leads to reduced costs and quicker deployments when compared to traditional large-scale nuclear plants. Moreover, SMRs come equipped with modern safety features, such as passive cooling systems, eliminating the need for external power or manual interference. Such innovations make it feasible to locate them near populated areas.Can Singapore Achieve Energy Independence?As Singapore commemorates its 58th anniversary of independence this month , it's crucial to highlight its heavy reliance on energy imports. Astonishingly, over 95% of the nation's electricity comes from imported natural gas. In today's world, marked by rising geopolitical tensions and the undeniable reality of climate change, energy security and sustainability have become focal concerns.Recognizing its energy challenges, Singapore has embarked on diversified energy strategies to decrease its dependence on fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The nation's primary emphasis in the pursuit of clean energy has been on solar power. However, with 4,067 solar panel installations across the city-state, this only fulfils 2.3% of Singapore's electricity demand.In a move to bolster its renewable energy sources, Singapore is set to tap into the existing interconnectors to import up to 100 megawatts (MW) of hydropower from Laos. This initiative is a result of the "Power Integration Project" founded in 2014. A noteworthy milestone was reached on 23 June 2022 when the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore commenced cross-border power trading under the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP). Under this arrangement, for a span of two years, up to 100 MW of electricity will be channelled from Laos to Singapore, passing through Thailand and Malaysia using the existing interconnections.However, this strategy is not without risks. Dependency Risk is a concern, as heavy reliance on imported electricity can render a nation susceptible to supply disruptions. If the exporting nation grapples with its own issues, it may prioritise domestic demands over exports. Additionally, Political Risks loom large. Diplomatic relations between nations can evolve, and any tensions might lead the exporting country to curtail or terminate supply as a strategic leverage.Could nuclear energy be the key to Singapore achieving energy independence? While true energy independence might be unattainable for Singapore due to its lack of indigenous natural resources, nuclear power can offer a more self-reliant solution than the current natural resources in use. Although Singapore would still need to import nuclear fuels like uranium from abroad, the dependence on these imports could be substantially reduced.Singapore stands to benefit from several Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technologies known for their efficient fuel use. Some noteworthy SMR technologies include:Integral Pressurised Water Reactor (iPWR): A compact design where primary system components are housed inside the reactor vessel, potentially requiring less fuelHigh-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors (HTGRs): Known for high thermal efficiencies and designs that make better use of fuelMolten Salt Reactors (MSRs): They use liquid fuel, enabling continuous reprocessing, and some can consume nuclear waste, reducing the demand for fresh fuelFast Reactors: Varieties such as the Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) and Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) operate on a closed fuel cycle, reusing fuel and minimising wasteTravelling Wave Reactors (TWRs): This fast reactor design can utilise less fissile materials like depleted uranium more effectivelyAdvanced Heavy Water Reactors (AHWRs): These leverage the more abundant thorium as fuelVery High-Temperature Reactors (VHTRs): A subtype of HTGR with extremely high outlet temperatures, ensuring high efficiencyLiquid Metal-cooled Reactors: Beyond SFRs and LFRs, designs such as the Bismuth-cooled Fast Reactor (BFR) also promise efficient fuel useMicroreactors: Designed for niche applications, these tiny reactors, with capacities under 10 MWe, can run efficiently on minimal fuel for long durations.Incorporating nuclear power into Singapore's energy mix could offer a potent solution, given its cost-effectiveness. By diversifying its energy sources in this way, Singapore would be better insulated against the fluctuations of the fossil fuel market. However, challenges related to safety and thermal pollution cannot be ignored, as they could result in long-lasting and harmful consequences.To make strides in this direction, the Singaporean government should invest in educating its youth about nuclear energy, rather than letting it remain a largely taboo subject. A starting point could be integrating discussions about nuclear power within the broader context of environmental sustainability and clean energy in school syllabuses. This would expose students to nuanced perspectives on the advantages and disadvantages of nuclear energy. At present, students' primary exposure to nuclear topics is limited to historical events like the bombing of Nagasaki in secondary school social studies classes.Given advancements in nuclear technologies, such as Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), it's imperative for the government to conduct a new pre-feasibility study.
