PHOTO: DOUGLAS HO, LIANHE ZAOBAO[PARIS] It is important for Singapore to build know-how on nuclear power and safety, even as the country has yet to decide whether to adopt the energy source, said Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. “At some point in time, some countries in the region may decide to have a nuclear power plant. And if they do, I think it’s important for us to also understand the implications for Singapore and have some capabilities with regard to nuclear safety,” he said on Saturday (Apr 13).He was speaking to reporters at the Singapore embassy in Paris, as he wrapped up a six-day official visit to Germany and France.On Thursday, Wong and French President Emmanuel Macron launched the France-Singapore Joint Year of Sustainability (JYOS), a series of events and initiatives from April 2024 to mid-2025, that highlights both countries’ cooperation in sustainable development and the green transition.Asked by The Business Times if nuclear energy could be of interest under the JYOS, Wong said: “Nuclear cooperation is certainly on the table. But it’s not so much about ‘let’s identify a nuclear project’, because we have not even decided to adopt nuclear power for Singapore.” Instead, Singapore is interested in enhancing its knowledge and capabilities on nuclear power, he added.A NEWSLETTER FOR YOUFriday, 12.30 pmESG InsightsAn exclusive weekly report on the latest environmental, social and governance issues.Sign UpSign Up“So it’s useful for us to learn more about nuclear power, more about the state of play with regard to nuclear technologies, and also enhance our capabilities with regard to nuclear safety,” he said.Wong noted that France has expertise running nuclear power plants and is doing research in advanced nuclear technologies. The country derives about 70 per cent of its electricity from nuclear energy with 56 operable reactors, according to the World Nuclear Association.Singapore has stepped up research around nuclear energy in recent years. The city-state has been tracking advanced nuclear technologies and aims to train at least 100 nuclear safety experts.

Industry experts said that Singapore is seen as a promising market for a new generation of nuclear reactors, known as small modular reactors. It could also be a research hub for nuclear fusion, a cleaner form of nuclear power still under development.Singapore is already collaborating with France on nuclear fusion, via the Singapore Alliance with France for Fusion Energy, a joint research centre between the Nanyang Technological University, the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission.Purchase this articlemore in Economy & PolicySingapore retail sales up 0.6% in August, driven by vehicle takingsOct 04, 2024 01:00 PMDaily Debrief: What Happened Today (Oct 4)Oct 04, 2024 06:30 PMSingapore’s PMI up further in September amid cooling in regional factory activityOct 02, 2024 09:00 PMDaily Debrief: What Happened Today (Oct 2)Oct 02, 2024 06:30 PMGovernment will do everything it can to help Singaporeans tackle cost-of-living concerns: PM WongOct 02, 2024 04:03 PMIswaran case may deter private-sector individuals from taking public appointmentsOct 02, 2024 05:00 AMDaily Debrief: What Happened Today (Oct 1)Oct 01, 2024 06:30 PMSingapore hotels’ room revenue dips in August despite higher average room rateSep 30, 2024 01:38 PMNewsBreaking NewsPropertyResidentialCommercial & IndustrialSingaporeInternationalStartups & TechOpinion & FeaturesESGWorking LifeCompaniesCompanies & MarketsBanking & FinanceReits & PropertyEnergy & CommoditiesTelcos, Media & TechTransport & LogisticsConsumer & HealthcareCapital Markets & CurrenciesWealthWealthWealth & InvestingPersonal FinanceCrypto & Alternative AssetsSupplementsLivingLifestyleFood & DrinkMotoringStyle & TravelWatchesArts & DesignBT LuxeMoreE-paperVideosNewslettersPodcastsPersonal SubscriptionGroup SubscriptionPaid Press ReleaseAdvertise with UsEvents & Awardsbt recommendsThriveTech in AsiaAsean BusinessGlobal EnterpriseSGSMEMobileabout uscontact ushelpprivacy policyterms & conditionscookie policydata protection policyMCI (P) 064/10/2023.
