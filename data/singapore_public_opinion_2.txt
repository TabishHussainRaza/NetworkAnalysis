Solar Tips by SunPro Energies
Solar energy will be the key in unlocking Singapore’s sustainable future. With impending climate action to take, the country has to weigh in on available resources and the imaginable tomorrow when making energy transitions.
In October, our Minister for Trade and Industry spoke about solar as the most viable form of renewable energy locally. This corresponds with the Energy Market Authority’s view. The nation is set to increase its solar deployment by seven times and install 2GWp solar capacity in ten years.
In this article, we uncover 4 main reasons why solar is the most ideal renewable energy for energy transition in Singapore at the present stage.
 
Limited Land Space 
Ultimately, Singapore is a city-state with limited natural resources. Despite its small size, it has developed into a thriving metropolis with booming economies and also, increasing energy consumption. Statistics have shown that our carbon emission per capita is twice that of a country with similar electricity consumption.
With the limited land space that Singapore has, wind and hydro power as alternative energy sources prove challenging, although not impossible. Architects, engineers and scientists will have to continuously push the boundaries to create co-existing spaces for a more liveable Singapore.
With solar energy, most of the panels are on our rooftops and largely out-of-sight. Moving forward, this could change as emerging options become available for solar PV systems to be installed. We can expect that solar power be more visible with the incorporation of vertically-mounted solar PV panels and mimicking of building materials like glass and concrete.
 
Geographical Position of the Country 
Lastly, Singapore lies right by the equator and its climate is stable all year round with high temperature and sunny weather conditions.
These conditions make it favourable to harness solar energy. Comparatively, wind is irregular and scarce and less ideal as a natural source of energy.
The warm climate also poses a challenge of increasing the country’s temperature. Outside of natural energy sources, the government is looking into energy-efficient systems such as the underground or indoor cooling system, whereby the building is monitored and programmed to cool down efficiently. With less air-conditioning used, less electricity is consumed as well.

 
Readiness of solar PV integration 
Across residential, commercial and industrial projects, Singapore has proved capable in handling solar PV projects. Increasingly, we are also seeing emerging technologies implemented — from remote data monitoring, to off-gird systems as well as vertically-mounted panels, among others.
Key partners in the industry have also opened up to the idea of long-term sustainability. Architects, in particular, are increasingly receptive and clearer of the necessity to build sustainable buildings that last. The theme for Singapore Archifest 2020, an annual festival that brings together architects, is ‘Architecture Saving OUR World’. The aim is to gather and brainstorm effective ways to reimagine the design of our city.
Singapore, alongside other countries, have committed to reduce our carbon emissions, with a longer-term view of achieving net-zero emissions at approximately the second half of the century. To achieve that target, solar power is the fastest and most effective energy source deployed till date. In fact, the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS) estimates that solar power can contribute 43 per cent of Singapore’s peak power demand during mid-day by 2050.
 
Potential to Diversify Our Energy Mix 
The variable nature of solar as an energy source – that the sun must shine – requires careful integration with existing and emerging power systems.
This transition must be approached in phases, evidenced from the uptake of solar photovoltaic systems by the Energy Market Authority (EMA). Singapore leaders are pushing ahead for solar deployment, frontloading our initial target of 1.5GWp of solar energy by 2025, to the current target of 2GWp by 2030.
Still, existing energy source from fossil fuel remains a priority for Singapore’s energy mix. We also must remain innovative in emerging trends such as bio fuels and hydrogen cells, doing our best to mitigate climate change with various forms of renewable sources. We are soon approaching a decade of increased solar deployment locally. We must also bear in mind, that we are battling decades of climate change ahead. Together, we can create a more sustainable and liveable future.
