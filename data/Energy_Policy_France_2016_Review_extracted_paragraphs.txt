9 1. EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY  
AND KEY RECOMMENDATI ONS  
PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES  
During the seven years since the last  International Energy Agency (IEA) in-depth review, 
the French government has set in motion significant reforms towards more secure, 
affordable and sustainable energy supplies and the green growth of its economy. France 
has witnessed the full decoupling of  its energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO 2) 
emissions from economic and population growth. Total energy supply and consumption 
as well as CO 2 emissions from fuel combustion have declined sharply over the past 
decade. The carbon intensity of the French  economy is half the IEA average and has 
decreased by almost 30% below its level in 2004 (versus an IEA average decline of - 20% 
during the same period). Outside transport, CO 2 emissions from fuel combustion have 
been falling fast. Since 2012, 3.3 gigawatts  (GW) of coal -fired capacity was closed , and 
the remaining oil- fired power plants are planned to be phased out. Energy savings in 
residential and industrial demand and reduced fossil fuel combustion have contributed 
to reduced energy supply and consumption  in France.  
A top priority for France has been to address climate change concerns. As host of the United Nations’ 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in December 2015, France 
demonstrated its domestic and international leadership in guiding societal dia logue 
towards climate change mitigation. At home, France has developed an ambitious and 
integrated energy and climate policy framework for the energy transition towards 2030 
and has adopted significant new policies, including carbon budget/pricing instrume nts, 
tax incentives and considerable public funding towards implementing it. The energy 
system transformation that France is undertaking entails significant structural changes 
for the energy sector through greater energy efficiency, larger contributions from 
renewable energies while ensuring the continuous low -carbon  nature and security of its  
electricity supply and the safe operation of France’s ageing nuclear fleet.  
The state , energy markets, industry and consumers will need to finance the investments 
required for the energy transition. Électricité de France  (EDF) ’s so-called Grand Carénage  
is a refurbishment and safety upgrades programme required for the long -term operation 
of its fleet. Its cost ( capital expenditures [CAPEX]) was updated in 2015 by EDF to 
EUR 47.5 billion over the period 2014- 25 (in constant euros of 2015). The electricity 
industry is undergoing considerable financial challenges, but the restructuring and recapitalisation by the state  should ensure that  resources and capabilities are available 
to also finance the energy transition. While the energy system transformation will strengthen energy security, green growth and affordability in the longer term, this 
transformation has implications for maintaining energy security in the short to medium 
term given the ageing of  the nuclear fleet. It is therefore welcome that France is 
encouraging demand response and will be starting a capacity market in 2017 with a view to ensuring  power system adequacy at peak demand and integrat ing larger shares of

10 variable renewables. Progress in phasing out regulated tariffs for non -residential gas and 
electricity users as of 1  January  2016 is another welcome step towards market pricin g in 
gas and electricity markets.  
ENERGY SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION  
France is one of the leading IEA countries when it comes to a low -carbon energy mix: 
only 47% of energy came from fossil fuels in 2015, thanks to the large share of nuclear 
energy, which made up 46% in the energy mix and 78% of electricity generation, the 
highest share worldwide.  
In August 2015, France adopted a long -term framework for the energy transition up to 
2030 and 2050. The Energy Transition for Green Growth Act (Loi relative à la transition énergétique pour la croissance verte, LTECV) is the result of the National Debate on the Energy Transition (DNTE), an intensive stakeholder consultation that ran from January to 
July 2013. The IEA welcomes the legal framework , which has binding targ ets and a 
carbon price trajectory up to 2030, and has put in place a governance framework based 
on the National Low -carbon Development Strategy (Stratégie nationale bas c arbone, 
SNBC ), five -year carbon budgets and a pluriannual energy programming (Programm ation 
pluriannuelle de l'énergie, PPE ) which covers energy production, energy efficiency, 
security of supply, and the supply/demand balance for all energy sources. These pillars can ensure periodical review and flexibility over time to adjust the trajector y and align 
policies to the targets of the Act.  This framework is an excellent achievement , and other 
IEA member and partner countries can learn from France’s experience.  
To drive long -term decarbonisation of the economy and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions by 40% to 2030, the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act acknowledges the 
need to accelerate actions in transport, industry and buildings, while maintaining a clean 
electricity mix. Sectoral strategies have been adopted: a low -carbon mobility strategy 
was presented in July 2016, with measures that build on France’s lead in the deployment of electric vehicles (EV) with 7 million EV charging points planned for 2030. In the buildings sector, the government aims to renovate 500 000 dwellings per year  and 
targets the renovation of low -income households under the Better Living Programme. 
Building codes have been strengthened with the new thermal renovation regulations of 2012.  
As the cornerstone of the transition, the role of renewable energy in the power mix is to be increased to 40% by 2030 (from its current share of 16.5%) , and France aims to 
accelerate energy savings while preparing for the future, given its  ageing nuclear fleet. 
The government set the ambitious  target of reducing the share of nuclear from 78% in 
2015 to 50% by 2025.  
France has witnessed growing shares of renewables, reaching 15% in total final consumption (TFC) in 2014. However, it is not yet on track towards achieving its target of 23% by 2020. The required growth in the next six years (2015 -20) will need to be twice 
that of the rates achieved over the last nine years (2005 -14). Targets have been reached 
for solar photovoltaics and biomass, which alone account for more than 36% of the 
growth of the renewable energy share since 2005, but there is a gap to be filled for 
hydro, wind power and heat. Onshore wind has reached about 10 GW , but offshore wind 
deployment has not started despite ambitious plans. Delays in the development of wind energy are  the result of non -economic barriers rather than economic ones, including the

1. Excecutive Summary  and key recommendations  
 
11 overlapping administrative and judiciary procedures for clearing a  permit of any claim 
(seven years on average for wind mills), coupled with a lack of social acceptance for wind 
and biomass. The Energy Transition for Green Growth Act introduced the single permit , 
which should improve permitting for onshore/offshore wind parks and reform the tax 
base for the funding of the new feed -in premium/feed -in tariff regime. However,  further 
work is needed with regard to the siting and grid connection of offshore wind and , in the 
long term, grid integration of variable renewable energy.  
The Act requires the reduction of total final energy consumption by 20% in 2030 and 
50% in 2050 , and the reduction of fossil fuel consumption of 30% by 2030, all compared 
to 2012 levels. France has improved the energy intensity of its economy by 16.5% for the last decade since 2005. TFC, which  has been declining since 2004, was down by 13% 
from the record- high  of 169.8 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2004. However, 
the current rate of decline is not yet enough to meet France’s energy savings target for 
2020, which requires 131 Mtoe versus 147.7 Mtoe (2014). The success of France’s energy transition will depend on the mobilisation of significant investment for the increase of renewable energy  and energy efficiency and the closure or long -term 
operation of the nuclear fleet. The long -term visibility of financing remains a challenge. 
Therefore, the stability of the carbon signal in the annual Finance Laws, the efficient remuneration in the electricity market and the predictability of the state  guarantees for 
technologies that are not yet competitive and sectors where high externalities are involved are critical.  
Commendably, the carbon trajectory can provide visibility to actors outside of the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme and encourages improvements in energy efficiency and low -carbon technology solutions. The first pluriannual energy 
programming was presented in 2016; however, it only covers the period up to 2023 and does not address the question of the long -term operation or closure of the French 
nuclear fleet, pending safety reviews by the French Nuclear Safety Authority in 2018/19. 
The gov ernment has yet to evaluate the cost -effectiveness of all measures for the 
energy transition, comparing the levelised cost of electricity of different technologies and changes in energy market fundamentals over the PPE horizon.  
France will need to track progress towards its ambitious targets. This requires robust 
energy data, indicators and resources to be allocated to this important exercise. The IEA 
encourages the government to continue the work on integrated energy –climate– air 
quality scenarios, building on those of the SNBC and the PPE, and to establish a tracking 
framework to assess progress towards the targets annually, including with regard to 
public/private sector investment compared to the SNBC. This can guide future carbon 
budgets, sectoral strategies and energy –climate– air quality plans developed at the 
various levels of administration. It will help evaluate the cost implications of the energy 
transition and provide an outlook for investment in low -carbon energy sources.  
The success of the energy  transition and its implementation will also rest on the capacity 
of local and regional authorities to put in to practice the objectives set out by the 
government. Regions are charged to carry out local climate, air and energy plans (plans 
climat –air–énergie territoriaux , and schémas régionaux climat– air–énergie ), which are 
co-ordinated by local authorities, next to regional energy efficiency plans, and to 
monito r compliance and achieve legal objectives. Such a decentralised approach is 
welcome because it can support a shift from a supply -side and centralised energy system 
to a more demand -oriented and decentralised one, and to the organisation of the 
energy transition. The IEA recommends that the government ensure that  not only the

12 authorities charged with the implementation of the energy transition at local and 
regional levels, but also regulatory and consumer authorities, have the requisite autonomy and resources to support and carry out their activities.  
ENERGY SECURITY  
France’s energy sector is shaped by the role of nuclear energy, which in 2015  accounted 
for 46% of total energy supply and 78% of the power mix. France holds the second -
highest installed capacity for nuclear (63  GW) and level of nuclear generation among IEA 
member countries after the United States and has the world’s highest share of nuclear in its electricity mix (78%). The French nuclear power programme was developed in the 
1980s, largely a result of the oil price shocks in the 1970s, but the fleet is reaching 
30 years and no decision  has been taken with regard to long -term operation, pending 
safety reviews. The Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) is expected to present the generic 
studies in 2018 that will inform the decisions of the operator EDF and shareholders with 
regard to the possible long- term operation (LTO) of the fleet and subsequent safety 
assessments at a plant -by-plant level.  
France is preparing for the transition of its nuclear fleet. The nuclear industry is 
constructing one new reactor at Flamanville (a European pressurised water reactor), 
which is expected to come online when the oldest plant in Fessenheim is closed  as 
anticipated in 2018. However, delays and technical challenges abound. The 
implementation of the 50% target remains challenging given the large role that nucle ar 
electricity plays in the French mix and the average age of the fleet.  
The 50% target would imply the closure of a large number of plants. Depending on the evolution of electricity demand, progress in energy efficiency , and renewables 
deployment, the 50% target may affect  the economics of electricity and final electricity 
prices, GHG emissions and the reliability of supply in France as well as exports to 
neighbouring countries. The government needs to ensure the security of the electricity 
supply at a time of increasing outages or suspension of ageing plants for increased 
maintenance, and to deal with decommissioning and long -term waste management. 
When implementing the target, through the PPE among others, the government should assess the safety and economic aspects of LTOs, the impact on electricity prices, GHG emissions, and the future of the French nuclear industry , and ensure that the industry 
has the long -term planning horizon to implement safety upgrades in a timely manner.  
Since 2009, the French government has also taken steps towards opening its historically 
monopolised gas and electricity markets. In response to the European Commission’s 
intervention, the government put in place regulated access to 25% of EDF’s nuclear electricity fleet for alternative suppliers under the so -called ARENH (accès régulé à 
l'électricité nucléaire historique ) mechanism in 2011, following the Act for the New 
Organisation of the Electricity Market (Nouvelle organisation du marché de l'é lectricité, 
NOME ). France has developed demand response in all energy, capacity and balancing 
markets, a valuable experience for other IEA member counties. Regulated tariffs were abolished on 1 January 2016 for medium -sized and large industry electricity and gas 
consumers. The government has increased transparency on the calculation of regulated tariffs and aims to reinforce social support programmes, like energy vouchers, while 
phasing out social tariffs offered by the incumbent supplier in support of the energy -
poor.

1. Excecutive Summary  and key recommendations  
 
13 In the gas wholesale market, the increasing level of competition and traded volumes at 
the French hubs and the market integration between north and south are encouraging 
news. However, electricity market opening is still lagging behind and  the market  remains 
highly concentrated, notably as the majority of the generation assets, hydro and nuclear, remain with the incumbent EDF , and attempts to reform hydropower concessions are 
not yet successful. The ARENH mechanism is conceived as a temporary measure until 2025 with a price of EUR 42 per megawatt -hour (MWh), but it has not achieved its 
objectives. Power purchases from the market are more attractive  given that  electricity 
wholesale prices have fallen below EUR 40/MWh. The government should promote competition by opening up concessions for hydropower facilities. When implementing the new capacity market in 2017, the government must  remain vigilant to ensure that 
there is  fair competition in the capacity mechanism for alternative and foreign suppliers.  
The government has not set a date for the phase -out of regulated tariffs for households, 
which are calculated on the basis of ARENH. Despite the emergence of competition and market offers, many households and small business consumers still choose to remain with regulated tariffs. Switching procedures, consumer empowerment, the roll -out of 
smart meters , and price comparison tools are just emerging. Despite having a large 
number of distribution system operators, EDF’s Enedis holds 95% of all the distribution network concessions , many of which will soon expire. Given that  the European Union is 
embarking on a new electricity market design, and the current network concession s are 
drawing near the end, the government has an opportunity to review distribution and 
retail sector regulations. Com mendably, the energy regulatory authority, the 
Commission for Energy Regulation (CRE), and the Energy Ombudsman support the 
process of market opening with a combination of competition, enforcement, regulation , 
and consumer education. The resources and competences of the competition authority, the energy regulator, and the consumer authorities have to reflect those priorities.  
Since 2009, the French government and operators have continued to develop 
interconnection capacity, notably in gas but also in electricity, where new sub -sea cable 
projects are planned. France is very engaged in the Pentalateral regional forum discussions. In 2015, the high -level group between France and Spain put forward a 
roadmap of actions. A new French –Spanish  electricity interconne ction was inaugurated 
and has been operational since 2015. France has already reached a level of interconnection with its neighbours that is above the 10% EU target as threshold. In fact, 
interconnections are not only good for exports but crucial to enhance France’s security of supply, particularly since  the country can be heavily dependent on electricity imports 
on cold winter days.  
KEY RECOMMENDATIONS  
The government of France should:  
 Ensure the long- term visibility for the financing of the energy transition through 
pluriannual energy programming and carbon pricing mechanisms,  and assess 
progress through adopt ing annual reviews and roadmaps based on robust scenarios.  
 When implementing the targeted share of 50% nuclear in the power mix , guarantee 
continuo us security of electricity supply and maintain the low -carbon footprint, 
building on an analysis of supply/demand patterns. Take into account safety and 
economic aspects when deciding on the long -term operation of France’s 
Generation II plants and new Gene ration III plants.

COUNTRY OVERVIEW  
In 2015, metropolitan France had a population of 64.7 million inhabitants (66.7 inclu ding 
its overseas territories). With a land area of 549 087 km2, France is the largest country in 
the European Union (EU ). Its population density of 118  inhabitants/km2 is above the 
OECD average of 35, but in line with the EU average of 112. France’s population is 
growing at a rate of 0.4% per year. The country  benefits from a large geographical 
diversity as it borders the Mediterranean  Sea, the Channel and the North  Sea, the Rhine 
and the Atlantic Ocean. France has the second largest maritime area in the world , 
11 million km2 of exclusive economic zone,  behind the United States , and has  around 
500 ports, including seven commercial state ports . About  70% of France’s trade volume 
is made by sea route.  
President François Hollande is the head of state under the Fifth Republic (C onstitution of 
4 October 1958) following the presidential elections of 2012, with Prime Minister 
Bernard Cazeneuve  as head of government. Ms. Ségolène Royal has been Minister of 
Environment, Energy and the Sea since 2014. The next presidential elections are 
scheduled for April and May 2017.  
In the 2012 election campaign, François Hollande made a commitment to the energy 
transition, which is the key domestic priority of Minister Royal together with France’s 
international leadership on  climate change. In December 2015, France hosted the 21st 
Conference of the Parties (COP21) under the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) which successfully concluded the Paris Agreement. In July

18 2016, France presented its sustainable development goals to the U nited Nations as one  
of 22 first -mover countries to implement the UN Agenda 2030, adopted in 
September 2015.  
In 2015, France reformed its regional governance and reduced the number o f 
administrative regions from 27  to 18 (as of 1 January 2016 , see Figure 2.6). There are 
13 regions with 101 départements  in metropolitan France (including the territorial 
collectivity of Corsica) and five located overseas (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, 
Martinique, Mayotte, and La Réunion), the so-called départements d'outre -mer (DOM) . 
All territorial collectivities have their own local assemblies and executives. This in -depth 
review covers only metropolitan France and not the DOM.  
The fifth largest economy in the OECD, France shows high standards of living thanks to a 
well- educated workforce, work- life balance, environmental quality and low average 
income inequality that, unlike many other OECD countries, have not worsened over time  
(OECD, 2016) .  
France has a diversified industrial structure, a sound banking system and in general 
terms, high educational attainment. GDP per capita , USD 39 813, is at the OECD average 
(USD 39 976).  However, France’s fundamental economic problem is a lack of economic 
growth. Unemployment is at a high level and still rising (10% in total, but 23% of 
population  under the age of 25). Over the past decades, France has had a structurally 
weak real economic growth with the second highest level of  public spending  among 
OECD countries  (58% of GDP in 2014) and a rising government debt (119% of GDP in 
2014). The competitiveness of the French industry has been decreasing. The OECD project s an economic growth rate of 1.6 % in the coming years.  
France is a founding member of the European Union (EU), the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Group of Seven and the United Nations 
(UN), and holds a permanent seat in the UN Security Council.  
SUPPLY AND DEMAND  
SUPPLY  
France’ s total primary energy supply (TPES)1 was 245.7  million tonnes of oil -equivalent 
(Mtoe) in 2015. Since the peak of 270.9 Mtoe in 2005 , TPES contracted by 9.3%  
(Figure 2.2). Nuclear accounted for 46.4% of TPES in 2015, the largest share of nuclear in 
TPES among IEA members (Figure 2.3), though 3% lower than in 2005 .  
Fossil fuels accounted for 46.6%  of TPES, made up of oil (28.8 %), natural gas (14.3 %) and 
coal (3.6%). Renewable energy sources accounted for 9.2 % of TPES, made up of  biomass 
and waste (6.1 %), hydro (1.9 %), wind (0.7 %), solar (0. 3%) and a marginal portion of 
geotherma l (0.1%).  
TPES from renewable energy grew by 35.4 % over the past decade to 2015.  As such, the 
total share of renewables in TPES has increased by only 3 percent age points from  6.2%  in 
2005 to 9.2% in 2015.  
                                                                 
1. TPES is made up of production plus  imports minus   exports  minus  international marine bunkers minus  international aviation 
bunkers plus/minus stock changes. This equals the tota l supply of energy that is consumed domestically, either in 
transformation (for example refining) or in final use.

20 In 2015, energy imports amounted to 147.8 Mtoe with 32.9 Mtoe of exports. Oil imports 
totalled 98.2  Mtoe ( 66.4 % of total imports), with 39.4  Mtoe of natural gas  (26.7%) and 
8.8 Mtoe of coal (5.9%). Exports were made up of oil products (21.3 Mtoe , 64.8% ), 
electricity (6.4  Mtoe , 19.4% ), and natural gas (4.9 Mtoe, 14.8%) . Imports have declined 
by 16.9 % since 2005  while exports decreased by 6.2 % during th e same  period. The 
strongest decrease in imports came from coal, which declined by 37.7% over the past 
decade to 2015.  
France produced 137.3 Mtoe of energy in 2015 , 83% of which stems  from nuclear with 
the remainder from biofuels and waste (10.8%), hydro (3.4%), wind (1.3%), oil (0.7%), 
solar (0.6%) and a negligible portion of geothermal. Energy production in 2015 was 0.2% 
higher than in  2005. Production has remained relatively stable  over the past decade to 
2015, with the exception of the 5.7% decrease in 2009, during the global financial and economic crisis, followed by  a 5.3% recovery in 2010.

DEMAND 
France ’s total final consumption (TFC)2 amounted to 147.7  Mtoe in  2014 . TFC represents 
around 60.9 % of TPES, with the remainder used in power generation and other energy 
industries. TFC reached a record high in 2004 at 169.8  Mtoe . TFC has declined by 13% 
over the past decade to 2014  (Figure 2.5). The strongest decline was  by 6.9 % during 
2011.   
Transpor t is the largest consuming sector and accounted for 29. 5% of TFC in 201 4, or 
43.5  Mtoe. The industr ial and residential sectors represented 27% and 2 5.3%, 
respectively, while the commercial sector consume d 18.2%. Since the peak in 2004, 
transport and industry have reduced demand by 3.6% and 20.3 %, respectively, while 
residential and commercial demand fell by 15.4% and 11.7 %. The sharp decline  of TFC  
reflects the structurally weak  economic growth  and energy efficiency progress in 
residential and commercial and services sectors  (see Chapter 3 on Energy Efficiency).

INSTITUTIONS  
The Ministry of Environment, Energy and the Sea (Ministère de l'e nvironnement, de 
l'énergie et de la m er, MEEM ) covers a large portfolio along seven pillars: sustainable 
development, energy, air quality and climate, infrastructure and transport, water and 
biodiversity, buildings and sustainable cities, risk prevention , and the sea and the coast. 
Within MEEM, the Directorate -General  for Energy and Climate (DGEC)  plans and 
implements policies in energy markets and energy supply (including nuclear), air quality, 
international climate change negotiations, mitigation and adaptation. Energy taxation is shared between MEEM  and the Ministry of Economy and Finance.   
Compliance with safety and radiation protection rules is carried out by the independent 
Nuclear Safety Authority (Autorité de sûreté nucléaire, ASN). 
Under the authority of MEEM and the regional authorities (pré fets), the regional 
directorates DREAL (directions régionales de l’environnement, de l’aménagement et du 
logement , DRIEE for Ile -de-France and DEAL  for DOMs and Corsica) work closely with the 
public to implement energy policy objectives , in particular thro ugh regional climate-air-
energy schemes (SRCAE) and territoria l climate -air-energy plans (PCAET).  
The Environment and Energy Management Agency (Agence de l’environnement et de la 
maîtrise de l’énergie , ADEME ) is a public agency under the joint supervision of MEEM  
and the Ministry of Higher Education and Research (MESR) , dedicated to energy 
efficiency and sustainable development, including broader remits, such as climate 
change and energy research and development. At the regional level, it is represented by 
regional delegations. 
The Commission f or Energy Regulation (Commission Régulation de l' Énergie, CRE) 
regulates the French gas and electricity markets and ensures the right of access to all

23 KEY POLICIES FOR THE ENERGY TRANSITION  
Building on the energy strategies and targets of the 2005 POPE L aw ( Loi n° 2005- 781 du 
13 juillet 2005 de programm ation  fixant les orientations de la politique énergétique ) and 
the 2007 -10 Grenelle Environment Acts (Grenelle de l’Environnement ), France has put in 
place an energy policy framework for the energy transition to green economic growth  
towards 2030. The new framework reflects France ’s internat ional climate change 
ambitions and leadership at COP21. The Energy Transition for Green Growth Act  (Loi 
relative à la transition énergétique pour la croissance verte, LTECV ) entered into force on 
17 August 2015 and is being implemented through  more than 15 0 regulations. The Act is 
the result of the National Debate on the Energy Transition (DNTE), an intensive 
stakeholder consultation that ran from January to  July 2013. The national debate  
discussed f our potential transition pathways (“factor4” target which equals a -75% of 
CO 2 reductions by 2050):  
1.  DEC – decarbonisation through electrification  
2.  DIV − diversification and moderate efforts for energy efficiency  
3.  EFF − strong efforts for energy efficiency  and diversification   
4.  SOB − strong efforts for energy eff iciency and sobriety and nuclear phase -out. 
No consensus was found on the best pathway to implement. However, a general agreement emerged from the pathway debate towards the core objectives that the 
energy transition should be economically profitable for France and lead to a strong cut in 
final energy demand and fossil fuel consumption , and that all no -regret options should 
be taken as soon as possible.  
THE ENERGY TRANSITIO N ACT  
The Energy Transition for Green Growth Act of 17 August 2015 is a comprehensive legal 
framework with the aim of tackling climate change and reinforcing energy independence 
and energy security.  The main five action principles of the French energy transition are  
i) to promote demand- side management and consumer engagement, energy efficiency 
and lower energy use, notably in buildings, ii)  to collaborate jointly with citizens, 
companies and territories and local authorities, iii)  to ensure transparency and 
information about the energy cost and prices, iv)  to develop energy research and 
innovation (low -carbon mobility, marine energies and energy storage), and v) to diversify 
the energy mix, further limiting the use of fossil fuels, diversifying electricity generation 
and increasing the share of renewable energies. As part of t he Act, several  energy and 
climate targets are made legally binding, notably  the:  
 reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission s by 40% in 2030 and by a factor of 4 
towards 2050 (compared to 1990)  
 reduction of final energy consumption by 2 0% in 2030 and 50% in 2050 (compared 
to 2012)  
 renewables share of 32% in gross final energy consumption and 40% of total  
electricity generation by 2030; 
 reduction of fossil fuel consumption  of 30% by 2030 (in comparison to 2012)  
© OECD/IEA, 2017

2. General energy policy  
 
24  reduction of nuclear share in the electricity mix down to 50% by 2025 (fro m 78 % 
today) and capping the installed capacity of nuclear power at the current level of 
63.2 GW  (to build one new reactor, France needs to close an old one)  
 reduction of municipal waste  production per capita of 10% over 2010 -20, including 
building and public work sectors  (circular economy) with 50% less landfill by 2025  
 a long-term carbon trajectory  from EUR 14.5  per tonne of CO 2 -equivalent  in 2015, to 
EUR 56/tCO 2 in 2020 and EUR 100/tCO 2 in 2030 , which is implemented through the 
annually confirmed carbon component in energy taxation and the EU-ETS.  
Besides the headline goals, the Energy Transition  for Green Growth Act includes policy 
proposals and strategies  for key sectors, including buildings, transport, waste, the 
circular economy, renewable energy and nuclear safety, and endorses a collaborative 
approach of government, industry, citizens and regional/territorial/local authorities. The government financially supports activities in the best performing energy -transition 
territories, positive- energy territories, and zero -waste territories.  
In the buildings sector, the government aims to increase the renovation rate (500 000 dwellings per year  by 2017 ) and to oblige  house owners to carry out energy 
refurbishment when restoring fa çades, re -roofing or converting a loft. The zero -interest 
eco- loans to finance energy refurbishment have been simplified and the scope of the 
energy transition tax credit (crédit d’impôt pour la transition énergétique, CITE ) 
increased to cover 30% of the  cost of any thermal refurbishment work up to a limit of 
EUR 8 000 for a single person and EUR 16 000 for a couple.   
In the context of the energy transition, the  government encourages low -carbon mobility 
and has presented a clean mobility plan. France has incentives to purchase clean 
vehicles (bonus -malus  scheme and  car conve rsion bonus of max imum  EUR 10 000)  and 
to finance electric vehicle (EV) domestic charging stations with energy transition tax credits. The government aims to install at least 7 million public and private EV charging points by 2030 and encourages initiatives to create “breathable cities” in five  years . It is 
preparing a nation al plan to reduce air pollution .  
Combating energy poverty should be improved by distributing energy voucher s to 
4 million vulnerable households. And 30% of the revenues raised from the energy 
efficiency certificates should be dedicated to fuel poverty under the “Better Living 
Programme ” of the French Agency for Habitation Improvement (ANAH) as 7 0 000 low -
income households shall be refurbished every year. Consumers will become more active with smart grids , with 35 million smart electricity meters  (Linky) and with 11 million 
smart gas me tres (Gazpar ).  
In the area of renewable energy, the Ener gy Transition  for Green Growth Act also sets 
out the reform of the  support scheme (feed- in tariff system ) and its funding 
(contribution aux charges de service public de l’électricité , CSPE
3) towards a market 
premium and calls for tender for large -scale mature renewable facilities. This aims to 
ensure the cost-competitiveness of renewable energies. In addition, the Act introduced  
the facilitation of crowd-funding for citizens and local authorities , and the use of the 
single permit for the construction of new wind energy, biogas and hydro -power facilities .

26 Substantial investments are needed  for the energy transition, in energy efficiency, in 
renewable energy and in the nuclear fleet.  While the carbon trajectory in the Energy 
Transition for Green Growth Act will ensure the reduction of fossil fuels use over time in 
the sectors outside the EU- ETS, the reformed renewable support scheme and EDF as the 
owner and operator of the French nuclear fleet will  need to  shoulder the cost of the 
energy transition.  
Amid rising financial  deficits of the previous renewable energy support scheme ( under 
contribution to public service electricity, CSPE), the government revised the scheme with 
a view to broaden the tax base to contributions  from all energy users, not only electricity  
consumers (see section on green taxation below and Chapter 9 on Renewable Energy).  
Over the past few years, the cost of renewable energy technologies has  been coming 
down globally and in France (where recent solar PV bids included remunerations at 
EUR 87 to EUR 70/MWh), but not as fast as in other EU countries.  
One of the main financing challenge relates to the operation of the French nuclear fleet, 
notably the cost of the new nuclear reactors (like the European P ressurised Water 
Reactor EPR in Flamanville), the cost of closure and decommissioning of existing plants 
by the end of their design life of 40 years and /or the cost of long- term operation (LTO) of 
the existing fleet beyond the design life to 50 or 60 years (so -called Grand Carénage ), 
which is estimated to amount to EUR 100 billion for the period 2014- 30 by the  French 
auditor Cour des Comptes  (CdC, 2016)  or at least EUR 47.5 billion up to 2025 (EDF 
estimate). No decision has been taken with regard to the LTO by  EDF pending the fourth 
periodic safety review of the  French Nuclear Safety Authority  (ASN ) in 2018/19 and 
plant-by- plant safety assessments for the decennial review. Increasing cost overruns of 
the EPRs in France and abroad have put pressure on the financing of the French nuclear 
power sector. The takeover of AREVA by EDF adds to the financing challenges.  
Declining wholesale electricity prices (dropp ing below EUR 40/MWh in 2014 and 2015) 
have reduced interest in the  regulated access to historic nuclear electricity (ARENH, 
accès regulé à l’électricité nucléaire historique) price of EUR 42/MWh  which was 
supposed to guarantee access to nuclear electricity at cost for alternative energy 
suppliers . According to the IEA/NEA study on the Projected Cost of Electricity Generation 
(IEA/NEA, 2015), the levelised costs of electricity were EUR 115/MWh for the Generation 
III new nuclear and EUR 35/MWh for Generation II nuclear with long -term operation.5 
Ageing nuclear reactors, safety concerns and maintenance has led to an increased shut 
down of French nuclear reactors, notably in 2016. With the closure of coal - and oil -
fuelled plants, baseload capacity has decreased further. France is launching the  capacity 
market to ensure the security of supply in the energy transition. The European Commission (EC) carried out an  inquiry into capacity mechanisms in several EU member 
states , including in France. On 8 November 2016, the EC approved the revised French 
revised market -wide capacity mechanism under EU state aid rules . Those revisions  
will make it possible to include capacities located across the border (as of 2 019)  and 
allow new players to enter the market. The capacity market is planned to start on 
1 January 2017 .  
                                                                 
5 The calculation is based on the capital cost of EUR 850 million for the refurbishment of a 1 000 MW e plant ( EDF estimate), a 
discount rate of 10% (highest value), and integrates operation and maintenance  and fuel cycle cost s (including waste 
management and decommissioning provision) of EUR  4/MWh.

29 PUBLIC FUNDS  
The government launched several calls for proposals for competitive tenders: it 
promotes about 500 positive -energy territories for green growth, zero -waste territories, 
1 500 biogas plants in rural areas and initiatives under the plan for “breathable cities 
within five years”.  The loan facility of the Caisse des dépôts  has been increased to  
EUR 5 billion to finance initiatives at territorial  level on renewable energy, buildings and 
clean transport. The governmental Energy Transition Financing Fund has been created 
with EUR 1.5 billion over three years, mainly directed to the Heat Funds and energy refurbishment initiatives for private -sector dwellings, and to support the winners of 
competitive tenders in the waste prevention and positive energy territories . The ADEME 
"air" fund will encourage local authorities to create grants for the renewal of inefficient 
individual wood burners.  
ASSESSMENT  
Since the last in -depth review in 2009, the government has consolidated its general 
energy policy towards an integrated energy and climate policy framework for the energy transition. By international comparison, France leads with ambitious energy and climate 
objectives, set under a legal and governance framework which is based on a national 
low-carbon strategy, five -year carbon budgets, a plur iannual investment planning and 
tracking process  as well as a carbon price trajectory up to 2030.  
Building upon pre vious objectives set under the POPE  Steering Law of 2005 and the 
Grenelle Environment I and II Acts (Grenelle de l’Environnement ) in 2007 -10, France 
created a comprehensive and long -term energy transition framework for the period to 
2030 and 2050 with the adopti on of the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act  in 2015 
(Loi relative à la transition énergétique pour la croissance verte, LTECV). The decision of the French government to design a framework with legally binding targets that is  based 
on a broad national debate of the future transition and a  price on carbon with a 
trajectory up to 2030 is a commendable decision and other IEA member countries can 
learn from this experience.  
The French energy transition builds on the gradually shifting contribution from nuclear 
power during the transition while phasing  in an accelerated deployment of renewable 
energy technologies over time. The Energy Transition for Green Growth Act endorses 
ambitious energy and climate targets that are multiple, ambitious and cover several time 
frames (2020, 2025, 2030, 2050).  
To implement this ambitious trajectory, France is currently introducing rules and laws to 
reach the targets  through a new governance, tracking, and planning, including at local 
levels, so as to provide visibility in the way  the energy transition is financed .  
First, France has adopted an integrated planning and tracking approach for the co -
ordination of all climate and energy targets in the 2030 horizon, which is commendable. There are two main planning instruments in  place, namely the  national low-carbon 
strategy and related carbon budgets , and a pluriannual energy programming (PPE), in 
addition to a number of initiatives and strategies, such as the energy research and 
development strategy and a clean transport and mo bility strategy. Under  Article 174  of 
the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act  the tracking of energy investment, public 
and private,  is required, including investments.  Investments will b e compared with those 
of the reference scenario  in the carbon bud gets.

2. General energy policy  
 
30 Planning and review ing carbon budgets and energy investment periodically allows  a 
flexible approach to adjust action  over time.  Gl obal changes  affect technology costs and 
energy markets. P rogress and cost s need to be reviewed over time , notably the levelised 
cost of electricity , the  needs implied by  robust energy and climate scenarios, data and 
indicators . Resources will need to be allocated to this important exercise. In addition  to 
the five -year carbon budgets and PPE, an annual roadmap assessing progress and 
outlining forthcoming policy initiatives can help to ensure timely implementation and 
visibility of the government ’s  action for all market participants.  
Therefore, the  IEA encourages the government to continue its  work on energy -climate-
air quality scenarios ; to establish a robust tracking framework to assess progress 
towards the targets  with indicators, to identify the required investment  to evaluate the 
costs and impacts on GDP/employment (green growth) ; to guide future carbon budgets , 
including the outlook for investment in low- carbon energy sources ; and to inform the 
strategies developed at the various  levels of administration.  
Secondly, the success of the energy transition and its implementation will also rest on 
the capacity of local and regional authorities to put in effect the objectives set out by the 
government. Regions are charged to carry out local climate, air and energy plans which are co -ordinated by local authorities (plans climat –air–énergie territoriaux, sch émas 
régionaux climat –air–énergie ), monitoring of compliance , and achieving legal objectives. 
Such a decentralised approach is welcome, as it support s a shift from a supply- side and 
centralised energy system to a more demand -oriented and decentralised one and to the 
organisation of the energy transition. The IEA recommends the government to ensure that authorities charged with the implementation of the energy transition at local and regional levels but also regulatory and consumer authorities , have the necessary 
autonomy and resources to support and carry out the se activities. 
Thirdly , France continues green tax incentives, directs increasing public funds to the 
energy transition and puts a price on carbon. France has made strong progress in 
taxation.  It is leading at international level by setting a carbon trajectory under the 
Energy Transition Law , by introducing an incremental carbon component in the fossil 
fuel consumer ’s excise tax, by setting out a carbon trajectory and by tackling the reform 
of the CSPE.  However, for historic reasons, there is a plethora of taxation instruments, 
including many exemptions. If France wants to  drive decarbonisation of the economy, 
notably tran sport, industry and  agriculture, it has to increase its efforts  towards creating 
a comprehensive  green energy taxation (based on robust carbon pricing and revised tax 
exemptions) to reflect the value of mitigation action and to stimulate the reduction in 
fossil -fuel consumption. The IEA calls for the completion of the green tax ation  reform as 
a critical element to support the financing of the energy transition in the long term 
through private and public investment.  
Amid low electricity wholesale prices and  low EU ETS  carbon price , the energy industry 
lacks the long -term visibility that is essential for invest ing in the electricity sector . This  is 
at the heart of the energy transformation given the ageing nuclear fleet and the ambitious energy and climate goals of the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act (see 
also Chapter 8 on Electricity and Chapter  10 on Nuclear Energy ). The first PPE was 
adopted on 27  October 2016, covering the years of 2016 -23, but it did not tackle the 
question of the long -term future of the French nuclear fleet. The decision to close  
nuclear power plants or to extend their operating life to beyond 40 years will have to be 
taken during the second period of the first PPE (i.e. 2018 -23), de pending on the 
evolution of many uncertain parameters such as  electricity demand (especially peak

31 demand), the energy mix of neighbouring countries, power imports and exports , or the 
costs of the nuclear fleet lifetime ex tension itself. Recent safety concerns in France 
highlight the challenge and systemic risks of long -term operation and the need to take 
an ambitious pathway in the energy transition.  
It is therefore welcome that the  PPE gives clear visibility concerning the fast 
development of renewables, which − as a no -regret measure – despite decreasing 
technology cost will need to be strongly supported in order to  contribute to achieve the 
reduction of  the current 78% share of nuclear energy in the electricity mix to 50% by 
2025. To achieve a share of 50% by 2025, without increasing CO 2 emissions, would 
require an increase of non- hydro renewable energies (wind, solar, biomass) from their 
current level of  6.8% to 34% within 10 years,  assuming a stable electricity demand.  
The investment challenge lies with the energy industry and the public sector, given the 
large  share the government holds in the country’s energy sector. Maintaining a low -
carbon energy mix and reducing the share of nuclear energy means that investment will need to be redirected to renewable energy, and to be balanced against the cost of the long- term operation of the existing nuclear reactors under safe conditions.  
The government is invited to continuously address these challenges in a timely manner 
both within the scenarios and the PPE  and through the capacity mechanism , in light of 
the decisions by the French Nuclear Safety Authority and along the energy and climate 
goals, so as to manag e the costs of the energy transition.  
RECOMMENDATIONS  
The government of France should: 
 Ensure the long -term visibility for the financing of the energy transition through 
pluriannual energy programming and carbon pricing, and assess progress through 
adopt ing annual reviews and roadmaps based on robust scenarios.  
 Use a robust and transparent scenario -based modelling to track progress and 
investments so as to guide the planning of the pluriannual programming and the national low -carbon s trategy amid changing energy markets, to ensure coherence 
and synergies between the various targets and planning exercises at national and local level.  
 Work in collabo ration with regions and local authorities and strengthen their 
resources to implement the objectives set out under the Energy Transition for Green 
Growth Act, notably in the framework of the pluriannual programming and the 
regional and local plans for energy efficiency, renewable energies, air quality, GHG emissions mitigation and research and development activities.

OVERVIEW  
France has one of the lowest carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions per capita among  
International Energy Agency (IEA) member countries  (rank ing fifth ). It accounts for 1.2 % 
of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but for 4.2% of global gross domestic product 
(GDP ). 
Since the end of the 1990s, France has  fully  decoupled CO 2 emissions and primary 
energy supply from economic and population growth (Figure 3.1). The carbon intensity of the  French economy has been declining  fast in recent years , largely thanks to the 
reduction in industrial demand, greater energy efficiency, the stable  share of nuclear 
(46% in the energy mix and 78% of electricity generation, the highest share in an IEA 
member countries  and in the world) and the ever- decreasing reliance on fossil fuel 
combustion. 
France ratified the Kyoto Protocol in May 2002 and was able to meet its targets without 
the purchase of international credits . Its international commitment was to stabilise its 
average annual GHG emissions at the base -year level of 1990. Not only was  France able 
to meet its Kyoto commitment  but it reduced its emissions by 7. 5% over the first Kyoto 
commitment period (2008 -12) under the United Nations Framework Conven tion on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) .  
According to the latest UNFCCC data  for France , energy production accounted for 12 % of 
total GHG emissions of France  in 2014 . Transport is the largest contributing sector (28%), 
followed by buildings (20%), with agriculture and forestry  contributing 19 % in 2014. The 
industrial process sector account ed for 18% while waste accounted for 4% of total GHG 
emissions.

3. Climate change and air quality  
 
45 power plants in Le Havre and Cordemais (with flue gas desulphuris ation and 
denitrification systems) is ongoing, in order to enhance technical and environmental 
performance and comply with  Directive 2010/75/EU. More precisely, smoke 
denitrification in these plants will allow capturing 80% of nitrogen oxides, 90% of sulphur 
dioxide and 99% of fly ash according to EDF . 
The IEA  estimated that 6.5 million deaths  worldwide are linked to air pollution with the  
number set to increase significantly in coming decades unless the energy sector takes greater action to curb emissions  (IEA, 2016b). Energy production and use – mostly from 
unregulated, poorly regulated or inefficient fuel combustion – are the most important 
man- made sources of key air pollutant emissions: 85% of particulate matter and almost 
all of the sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides. They stem from factories, power plants, 
cars, trucks, and from the 2.7 billion people worldwide who are still relying on polluting 
stoves and fuels for cooking (mainly wood, charcoal and other biomass).   
The IEA calls for government action in three key areas:  
 Setting an ambitious long- term air quality goal, to which all stakeholders can 
subscribe and against which the efficacy of the various pollution mitigation options 
can be assessed.  
 Putting in place a package of clean air policies for the energy sector to achieve th is 
long- term goal, drawing on a cost -effective mix of direct emission controls, 
regulation and other measures, giving due weight to the co -benefits for other energy 
policy objectives.  
 Ensuring effective monitoring, enforcement, evaluation and communication: keeping 
a strategy on course requires reliable data, a continuous focus on compliance and on policy improvement, and timely and transparent public information.  
CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPT ATION  
France has witnessed  an increasing number of heat waves and its large nuclear power 
generation fleet requires significant amounts of water cooling. France  also relies on 
electric heating and cooling during peak consumption periods and depends on 
hydropower availability for electricity generation.  
France has a long coast line, as it borders four seas : the North Sea, the Channel, the  
Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Rising sea levels or more frequent inundations also impact energy infrastructure, including energy importing -exporting ports, e.g. liquefied 
natural gas (LNG ) term inals. 
In 2010, France adopted a first  National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (PNACC) for the 
period 2011 -15 with 84 actions in 20 areas, which underwent a mid -term review in late 
2013. In the PNACC, the  government identified significant consumption peaks  during hot 
and cold spells and lower water availabilities during drought periods as the key risks in 
the energy sector which require adaptation. Measures include a capacity mechanism in 
the electricity market to ensure peak generation, efficient heating and cooling from  
renewable energy sources, and improving the availability and quality of h ydrogeological 
and climate data, integrating climate change impacts in the monitoring of the water 
beds, as part of the EU Water Framework Directive , and identifying  French industrial 
sectors which are vulnerable to climate change.

3. Climate change and air quality  
 
47 France already has a very low -carbon energy mix, thanks to the leading role of nuclear 
energy, which accounted for  78% of electricity generation  in 201 5, to the role of hydro 
(10% in the electricity mix) and the gradual closure of old coal- and oil- fired power 
plants, partly as a consequence of EU air quality requirements. CO 2 emissions per capita 
are half the IEA average and France ranks fifth -lowest in its carbon intensity among IEA 
countries.  
In 2014, France’s GHG emissions reached 464.4 MtCO 2-eq, excluding LULUCF, that is 
15.4 % below 1990 levels.  French climate targets under  UNFCCC (Kyoto Protocol and 
Doha amendment) are linked to the EU 2020 E nergy and C limate Package. The 
government met its climate targets  under the Kyoto Protocol for the first commitment 
period (2008 -12); when in fact GHGs declined by 7.5%.  
Since 1990, GHG emissions have seen a sharp decline, thanks to large reductions in 
industry and energy p roduction. However, emissions in the transport, waste , and 
residential and services (buildings) sectors are still growing. Energy- related CO 2 
emissions in 2014 stem mainly from the transport sector (42.4%), residential and 
services (28.1%) and manufacturing industries  (15.7%), power generation (10.1% ), other 
energy industries (3.7% ). Commendably, policies and measures envisaged under the 
Energy Transition  for Green Growth Act target emissi on reductions in those sectors and 
France has put in place five-year emis sion limits (carbon budgets) in line with the 
national low- carbon s trategy and the carbon trajectory. They target emission s 
reductions across the  economy, including in  transport, buildings and industry , in each 
budget period towards 2030 an d 2050.   In the medium- term towards 2025 and 2030, the 
success of the se emissions reductions will depend on  the actual contribution of 
renewable energies and the speed of building s renovation, as well as on efforts to 
reduce the emissions in the transport sector but, crucially , on the future role of nuclear 
energy the contribution of which to the electricity mix is targeted to decrease to 50% by 
2025 from 78% in 2015.  
Building upon earlier attempts to adopt a carbon tax in France, the government  
successfully introduced , under the 2014 Finance Law , a carbon component in the  energy 
tax which is proportional to GHG emission content. Sectors outside the EU-ETS are 
subject to the tax, while EU -ETS sectors are charged at a stable rate of EUR 7 /tCO 2. For 
the EU -ETS, the government announced plans to introduce a carbon price floor in 2016  
at the level of EUR 30/tCO 2 which would be limited to coal- fired power plants and equal 
de facto  to a coal tax. Howe ver, these plans were not realised by the time of writing.  
Another area of progress is the gradual reduction of  the gap between diesel and gasoline 
taxation within five  years. The government has started to tackle this  differential in 
taxation. However, there are many tax exemptions on  fossil fuel consumption in place 
for several sectors which prevent the tax system from adequately reflecting the externalities of transportation, including the cost of infrastructure investment and congestion. The IEA encourages the government to review all energy taxation in order to 
make it an effective and central instrument of policy implementation. Continuous focus 
on energy taxation, notably to fully abolish the differential between diesel and gasoline 
taxation, would be important for emission s reductions in non -ETS sec tors (transport, 
agriculture) and improve air quality. The government should complete the revision of 
the energy -climate taxation to better reflect the cost associated with climate change and 
air pollution  and to avoid wasteful consumption so as to encourage citizens and 
manufacturers towards clean mobility, heating  and agriculture (as part of the new 
industrial plans under the Energy Transition for Green Growth  Act).

3. Climate change and air quality  
 
 
 
48 France continues to struggle with local air pollution and levels set  for the protection of 
human health are regularly exceeded in urban areas for concentrations of particulate 
matters (PM 10 and PM 2.5) and NO 2. France has been implementing a series of measu res 
and has a good potential to expand the use of natural gas, biofuels for freight and passenger transport, modal shift as well as to increase the penetration of electric 
vehicles in urban areas. While the government pursues a large range of policies to reduce air pollution (national plan for air pollution reduction, atmosphere protection plans with a focus on particulate matters and NO
x/SO x and transport policies), the IEA 
encourages the government to proceed with the implementation of these important mea sures, to foster the governance of national, regional/territorial and local action , and 
to ensure compliance with regulated limit values.   
Next to mitigation, adaptation to climate change impacts is becoming increasingly relevant for France, as the country’s energy sector is facing significant heat waves, with 
consumption peaks in hot and cold spells and lower water availabilities during drought 
periods. However, power generation (with the majority coming from hydro and nuclear) 
strongly depends on water for cooling purposes. Challenges from climate change cannot 
be ignored. Commendably, France has adopted a national adaption plan for 2011 -15, 
which contains 84 actions and 230 measures which has been reviewed in 2013 so as to 
prepare the new 2016 -20 p lan. France has yet to evaluate the positive/negative impacts 
of climate change on the industry sector in the longer term and adapt the water framework to the new challenges, including introducing new wate r-saving policies. The 
IEA welcomes the opportunity, with the  presentation of the new adapta tion p lan in 
2016, to prioritise actions in this regard.  
 
RECOMMENDATIONS  
The government of France should: 
 When reviewing the carbon budgets, assess the cost -effectiveness of the various 
GHG emission s reduction measures to evaluate and adjust the effectiveness of 
policies over time , including the carbon taxation.  
 Complete the revision of the energy- climate taxation in France with a view to better 
reflect costs associated with climate change and air pollution , reducing overlapping 
instruments and abolishing exemptions that encourage wasteful energy 
consumption.  
 Evaluate climate change impacts and devise measures for adaptation within the energy transition framework to foster the resilience of the energy sector to climate change impacts.

FINAL CONSUMPTION OF ENERG Y 
France ’s total final consumption (TFC) was 147.7  million tonnes of oil -equivalent (Mtoe) 
in 201 4. It has been declining since 2004, down by 13% from the  record- high  of 
169.8 Mtoe in 20 04 and decreased further to reach 1990 levels  (Figure 4.1). The sectoral 
split of TFC has remained almost stable over time.   
In recent years, there have been significant drops in TFC with negative growth rates, in 
2009, 2011 and 2014, mostly driven by declines in industry and linked to the structurally 
low economic growth . In 2011, France ’s TFC dropped the first time significantly in 
20 years, by 6.9%, but partially recovered over 2012 -13 by 4.8%. Again in 2014, TFC 
dropped by 6%, with the residential/commercial consumption  being the most volatile as 
the sector depends on the performance  of the French economy .

Since 1990, the specific energy consumption in steel industry has been decreasing as a 
result of the increased penetration of less  energy- intensive process es and the closure of 
old and less efficient steel mills. A lmost  half the steel production is based on  the use of  
recycled scrap metals . However, the  main furnaces in Dunk irk and Fos- sur-Mer produce 
from  iron ore and coal.  Thanks to the use of electric motors, several ways to improve 
efficiency were developed. These improvements may have a significant impact on 
overall energy consumptio n, as the steel  industry is one of the most energy -intensive 
industry sector s in France, together with cement and petrochemicals and chemical 
industries (Figure 4.15).

Aluminium  production is highly electricity -intensive. The energy intensity could be  
lowered both by improving energy efficiency and by increasing the use of scrap.

72 Freight transport  
France aims to induce a  modal shift from road transport toward s cheaper and lower-
emitting means of transport, notably by  encouraging rail freight . The target is to shift  5% 
to 10% of the traffic. In 2013, the Ministry of Transport announced the creation of a 
third motorway between Lille and Bayonne. The government supports the develop ment 
of new sea motorways on the French Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts in order to offer 
an alternative  to crossing the Pyrenees and the Alps.  
Passenger transport 
The third phase of the Development Plan of Reserved Public Transport Corridors 
(Programme de développement des transports en commun  site proper, TCSP ) was 
launched in M ay 2013. Projects include underground, tramway, tram -train, high 
efficiency bus service, waterway or river shuttle, investment in bicycles and innovative 
actions in the field of sustainable mobility. I n September 2013, the Minist ry of Transport 
announced the approval of almost 120 projects with a total funding  of EUR 5 billion.   
Road transport 
France has been  relying on the bonus -malus scheme to support the purchase of low -
emission vehicles (Box 4.2). Other measures have been implemented to encourage the 
purchase of more efficient vehicles in terms of energy consumption and GHG emissions. 
The annual tax on bus iness passenger cars,  established since 2006, is based on the 
vehicle’ s level of polluting  emissions not its horse power. Businesses are subject to this 
tax. A tax exemption is granted to those vehicles  which emit up to 50g CO 2/km. However, 
business vehicles enjoy price rebates for fuel consumption which does not encourage 
vehicle fuel economy.  
CASE STUDY : ELECTRIFICATION OF T HE TRANSPORT SECTOR 
Progress in battery technology and stronger support mechanisms in recent years have 
enabled a rapid deployment of electric vehicles (EV), with different policy approaches worldwide.  
France is an emerging EV market today and offers good conditions for the electrification of 
the car fleet. With nuclear electricity providing 77% of electricity, electrification of  the 
transport sector will ensure an important part of the transformation and de carbonisation  
of the transport sector. The government is looking into support for the development of an 
EV market and can use other countries’ strategies as an inspiration for developing efficient 
policies and measures.  
BENEFITS AND CHALLEN GES  
Transport consume s on average one -third of total energy use in IEA member countries 
and the sector is the main emitter of greenhouse gas es globally. EVs are more energy -
efficient than internal combustion engine vehicles (ICV) and enable low -carbon 
emissions if the electricity is supplied from low-carbon energy sources. Furthermore, EVs 
can reduce local air pollution and noise levels in urban areas. For oil- importing countries 
with high reliance on fossil fuels in the transport sector, EVs can also provide improved 
energy security.

76 Local governments are empowered to install public charging infrastructure with a quota 
of parking areas in  work places and shopping areas  reserved for electric vehicles and 
charging spots . Builders of collective residences must install charging facilities at parking 
places upon request of the inhab itants .  
Interoperability has been increasing. France’s municipalities (collectivites territoriales ) 
have signed agreements to ensure the interoperability of the charging network 
infrastructure. In 2016, the Federation of municipalities (Fédération nationa le des 
collectivités concédantes et régies (FNCCR) signed an agreement with Gireve 
(Groupement pour l'itinérance des recharges électriques de véhicules ). 
The impact of EVs on the electricity system ’s adequacy can be positive, and it is expected 
that EVs will outpace electric heating in the system over time. If the peak consumption in 
large cities coincides with peak charging hours of EVs, France could be exposed to local system operation constraints, notably in large cities during evening hours.  
IEA 25 ENERGY EFFICI ENCY RECOMMENDATIONS  
The IEA 25 Energy Efficiency Recommendations offer a framework for a comprehensive 
portfolio of policies. Table 4.4 summari ses the recommendations and assesses French 
energy efficiency policy priorities against this framework.  
Table 4. 4  IEA 25 energy efficiency recommendations     
Recommendation  Implementation and progress  
 
Energy efficiency across all sectors  
1. Energy efficiency data 
collection and indicators ADEME and MEEM collect  energy  data and lead international efforts in the area.   
Continue to develop data and policy metrics on sector-specific energy end-use data and 
energy efficiency to develop and evaluate energy policies, targets and measure s over time . 
2. Strategies and action plans, 
institutional structure 
(resources) France has established a comprehensive policy package for energy efficiency, namely a 
National Energy Efficiency Action Plan ( NEEAP), across various sectors. The third edition of 
the French NEEAP was delivered in 2014. The NEEAP regularly evaluates progress 
towards the targets and adjusted actions.  
 
MEEM is the main ministry in charge of promoting energy efficiency. ADEME is the national agency in charge of energy efficiency actions, under the supervision of M EEM and of the 
Ministry of Higher Education and Research.  
3. Competitive energy markets, 
with appropriate regulation A new mechanism ha s been set up through the NOME (New Organi sation of the Electricity 
Markets) law, the “ARENH mechanism” (a ccès régulé à l’électricité nucléaire historique)  
which has been implemented since July 2011. This mechanism aims at promoting 
competition in the retail market by allowing alternative suppliers to supply their clients in the 
same economic conditions as the incumbent. It provides every supplier with an access to 
wholesale baseload energy produced by the nuclear power plants owned by EDF at a 
regulated price reflective of costs. 
 
A capacity market  will be first implemented in 2017. It aims at ensuring that the level of 
security of supply defined by the government is reached at least cost. Security of supply is  a 
major challenge in France, whose electricity market is characterised by an intense peak 
demand .  
4. Measures to increas e 
investment in energy efficiency (private/public) The main instruments for France to finance energy savings in buildings, industry and 
transport are the white certificates and the tax credits (CITE). Government-sponsored economic instruments for energy efficiency include soft loans, tax credits to industry for 
voluntary energy efficiency  measures and direct grants, as well as awareness-raising 
campaigns. France i s part of the EU-ETS.  It is also operating white certificate schemes, 
which have entered  a third phase from the beginning of 2015.

80 The French government simplified its zero- interest loans, namely Eco -PTZ, and  increased 
the number of loans from 30 000 per year today to 100 000 per year. The tax reduction 
CITE, formerly CIDD, was simplified and raised to 30% of total expenses, whatever the 
thermal refurbishment action. Since January 2016, the CITE may be combined with the zero- interest loan.  
According to  ADEME’s  building observatory (Observatoire p ermanent de l’amélio ration 
énergétique du lodgement, OPEN),  3.5 million dwellings were renovated in France in 
2014, with an average investment of EUR 10  000 each , of which 288 000 were very 
extensive renovations (still below the targeted 500  000) , 1.8 million medium and 
1.44  million light renovations. A recent survey  found that 6 out of 10 hous eholds in 
France know at least one of the support incentives (most people are aware of tax 
incentives but know much less about  white certificates and eco -loans; see ADEME,  
2015).  Only 20% of households engaged in renovation used  a loan; only 41% carried out 
a deep renovation and 11% used a n eco-loan.  France is faced with deep renovations, as 
it has to renovate its  historic, public buildings and social housing but faces a large 
number of structural barriers, including low energy p rices, and a large share of electric 
heating and administrative barriers . For instance, in private collective housing 
(co-propriété ), the renovation of central heating systems or roofs requires a joint 
renovation decision by all owners.  
The majority of th e energy saving certificates issued is linked to investments in energy 
savings in buildings, and has seen strong performance, with established target levels exceeded during every period. The exchange price has fallen considerably and reached 
EUR 1.41/MWh in August 2016.  The objectives will need to be strengthen ed, in order to 
improve the value and use of the certificate s. 
District heating networks are rapidly developing, also  combined with the use of 
renewable energy sources.  Eco- friendly construction materials saw fast  growth, as well 
as high -performance windows and thermal insulation materials. The heating systems of 
the building stock are  being transformed to central heating systems . The deployment of 
efficient and renewable heating systems, such as condensing boilers, heat pumps and 
solar thermal, promoted by several subsidies or tax credits, improved the average 
heating energy efficiency. In the meantime, th e spread of air conditioning has steadily 
increased. Space heating r epresented the largest share of household energy use, and is 
very much depende nt on weather conditions .  
The Better Living programme has support ed energy efficient renovation for those 
households that need ed it the most, low -income households. During 2010 -15, about 
140 000 households benefited from the programme, well below the targeted 300 000 
for 2010 -17. However, progress is under way: 50 000 dwellings were renovated in 2014 
and 2015, and the objectives for 2016 are  to renovate 70 000 households. The 
government is confident that the targeted 300 000 social housing renovations  for 
2010 -17 are achievable. Energy vouchers and eco- loans for social housing should 
improve the performance and ensure beneficiaries of social housing support are better targeted. Under the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act,  the creation of an energy 
renovation guarantee fund (to apply for social renovation loans) will enable the 
provision of aid to finance works in one’s home . The funding is to come from a 
partnership with industry under the white certificates financing  system .

DEMAND 
France is the fourth -highest gas -consuming country in the European Union (EU ) behind 
Germany, the United Kingdom  and Italy. Gas use  was 36.7 bcm in 2014. The share of gas 
in TPES (14.3%)  is much lower than the EU average (23%), given the significant use  of 
(nuclear) electricity in the heating sector and France’ s lower population density (below 
EU average ), which has resulted in many rural areas still largely using fuel oil or biomass 
as they have no  gas network connection .  
Industry and households are the largest gas -consuming sector s in France . Industry  has a 
share of 3 3.4% in total demand in 2014. Households and the commercial sector 
(including agriculture, fishing  and forestry) consumed 33.1% and 19.8 %, respectively.  
The power generation  sector consumed 9.3%, other transformation sector  4.1% and 
transport the remaining 0.3% (Figure 5 .2). 
Since 2004, overall gas consumption has contracted by 19.3%. In 2014, g as consumption 
further declined by 7.2 bcm compared to 2013. G as demand had reached its record high 
in 2010 with 48.3bcm  and demand in 2014 was 24% lower compared to this peak . Much 
is related to the cold winter in 2010 and the milder winters in recent years, but also the 
economic and financial crisis which lowered gas use in industry.  
In 2014, d emand in the power generation sector decreased by 2.2 bcm or 39.2% 
compared to 2004. Industry and household sectors’ demand were lower 21.9% ( 3.4 bc m) 
and 27.5% (4.6 bcm), respectively.  
Conversely, the transformation  sector and commercial sectors showed increase in the  
demand of 89.7%  (0.7 bc m) and 10.7%  (0.7 bcm), respectively. Transportation sector 
demand increased by 118.8% (0.1 bcm) though  its share is marginal .   0 10 20 30 40 50 60

6. Oil  
 
103 6. OIL  
Key data (2015 estimated)  
Crude oil production:   0.833 Mt  
Crude oil , NGL and feedstocks  imports:  57.6  Mt, -31.6 % since 2005  
Oil products net imports: 19.7  Mt (imports 40.2 Mt, exports 20.4  Mt), + 99.5 % since 
2005  
Share of oil:  28.8 % of TPES and 0.3% of electricity generation 
Supply by sector  (2014):  70.2  Mtoe (transport 56.2%, industry 21.7 %, commercial and 
public services and agriculture 9.1 %, residential 8.8 %, other energy 3.2 %, power 
generation 1%) 
SUPPLY AND  DEMAND TRENDS  
The share of oil in France’s total primary energy supply (TPES) has declined markedly 
since the early 1970s, from 66. 5% in 1973 to 28.8% in 2015. Oil use in power generation 
has been replaced by nuclear energy which increased its share  in TPES from 2.2 % in 1973 
to 46.4 % in 2015. Although oil is no longer a major source of  energy, it still has a 
significant  share in TPES given its strong role in transport and industry.  
Oil is the second -largest energy source in France, accounting for 28.8 % of TPES. Oil 
supply totalled 70.7  million tonnes of oil -equivalent (Mtoe) in 2015, 0.6% higher than in 
2014 , but down from  86.3  Mtoe  in 2005.  
Crude oil  
France is a net crude oil importer. Because there is no substantial national  production, 
France imports nearly all crude  oil used to supply its refineries. French crude oil, natural 
gas liquids ( NGL ) and f eedstocks imports have declined sharply, from 84.2  million tonnes 
(Mt) in 2005 to 57.6  Mt in 2015.  
In 2015 , France produced 833 kilotonnes ( kt) of crude oil, 8.7% higher than in  the 
previous year and 22.8% lower than  in 2005. The amount of domestic production is only 
equivalent to 1.5% of total supply .  
Almost all imported crude oil and oil products enter into France through three main sea 
ports, at Le Havre  (42.5%), Marseille (42.1%) and Saint -Nazaire (15.4% ). Unloaded oil is 
processed in the refineries near these ports or inland refineries connected via pipelines 
to the ports. Some portion of oil transit s France by pipeline to Switzerland and Germany. 
The major suppliers of crude oil are Saudi Arabia (18.6 %), Kazakhstan (13.8 %), Nigeria 
(11.7%), Russia (7.9%) and Angola  (7.6 %). Members of the Organization of the Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC), including Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Algeria, Angola and Libya , 
collect ively represent more than half the total supply.

117 8. ELECTRICITY  
Key data (2015 estimated) 
Total electricity generation: 563.2  TWh, -1.4% since 2005  
Electricity generation mix : nuclear power 77.7%, hydro 9.7%, wind 3.8 %, natural gas 
3.5%, coal 2.2%, biofuels and waste 1.3%, solar 1.5%, oil 0.3%  
Installed capacity  (2014) : 128.9 GW  
Peak demand  (2014) : 82.5  GW  
Electricity consumption (2014): 431.6  TWh ( residential 34.6%, c ommercial, public 
services and agriculture 32.9 %, industry 25.8%, transport 2.9%, energy 3.8 %) 
SUPPLY AND DEMAND  
GENERATION  
France ’s net electricity generation amounted to  563.2  terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2015 , 
which is 1.4% lower than in  2005  and 1.1% higher than in 2 004, but below the historic 
peak of 571.2 TWh in 20 05. The electricity mix is dominated by nuclear power, 
accounting for 77.7% of the total in 2015. The a verage share of nuclear in total 
generation over the past decade was 77.5 %. During 2005- 15, generation from nuclear 
decreased at an annualised rate of 0.3% .  
Hydro , the  second -largest source, accounted for 9.7% of total generation in 2015  (or 
54.9  TWh). Renewables , including hydro , represented 16.3 % of electricity production in 
2015 , made up of hy dro (9.7 %), wind ( 3.8%), solar ( 1.5%) and biofuels and waste ( 1.3%). 
Renewables share in generation  increased from 10.2% in 2005. On average, biofuels and 
waste grew at 3.7 % per annum over the ten years  to 2015 , while solar and wind surged 
at 32.9 % and 36.2 % per annum, respectively , albeit with marginal share s. Hydropower 
generation has been volatile year -on-year . In 2015 it was 6.7 % higher than in  2005, and 
grew b y 0.6% per annum over the past decade to 2015.  
Fossil fuels accounted for 6% of electricity generation in 2015, made up of natural gas 
(3.5%), coal (2.2%) and oil (0.3%). Because of tighter environmental requirements but 
also lower profitability,  coal and oil are being progressively phased  out. Electricity 
produced from oil fell by 76% from 2005 to 2015, while coal use was down by 59.7 %, 
after closure of 10 coal units (3 gigawatts ). Electricity generated from natural gas  has 
decreased by 14.5 % and some new gas -fired power plants are being mothballed . In 
general, f ossil fuel -fired thermal plants have a supporting role in power generation, 
adjusting high or peak demand to complement nuclear and renewable energy sources.

119 In comparison to other IEA member countries, France ’s share of fossil fuels in electricity 
generation was fourth -lowest  in 2015  (Figure 8. 2). Its nuclear share is the highest among 
IEA countries,  followed by  the Slovak Republic and Hungary.  
For the first time  in 2014 , more electricity was produced from renewable sources 
(excluding hydro) than fossil fuels . Excluding hydro, generation stood at 36.9 terawatt-
hours (TWh ) in 2015  and more than half was from wind power , solar photovoltaics ( PV) 
and biomass . Hydropower generation was 54.9 TWh  in 2015, 12.6% lower than in 2014.  
Renewable energy sources covered 16.3% of total power generation in 2015 . Wind 
power capacities have grown significantly since 2008, from 3.4 GW to 9 GW, and solar 
from 80  MW to 5.6 GW in 2014.

DEMAND 
Electricity consumption in France in 2014 amounted to  431.6  TWh , 5.6% or 25.5  TWh  
below the previous year.  This decrease was due mainly to the mild  weather throughout 
the year, which was on average 0.5 °C above the reference level. It also reflects the 
overa ll slow- down in  economic activity  and the lower use of electric heating, which has 
been falling for several years as a result of the implementation of the  building code of 
the 2012 thermal regulation . Despite the decrease in electricity consumption, the an nual 
peak demand has seen a steady rise in the past years (see Figure 8. 4), reaching 100 GW 
in 2012.  However, the growth of peak demand has now reversed (92 GW in 2013 and 
82 GW in 2014) and follows the same pace as  energy demand.  
Residential (households) is the largest electricity -consuming sector, account ing for 34. 6% 
of total demand. Commercial and public services (including agriculture) and the industry 
sector account for 32.9 % and 2 5.8% of demand, respectively. The energy sector  
consumed 3.8% of total  demand while transport consumed 2.9% in 201 4.  
Demand from  households grew by 4.2% over the past ten years to 2014 while total 
demand decreased by 3.8%. Both the i ndustry and energy sectors decreased their

120 consumption by 18.5% and 43%, respectively, durin g th e same  period. Transport ’s 
demand increased by 0.5% albeit  being a marginal share of the total. Annual peak 
demand has been growing for several decades, but its growth rate is  slowing down in 
recent years, ranging from  92.6 GW  in 2013 to 82.5 GW  in 2014 (Figure 8 .4).

IMPORTS AND EXPORTS  
France holds a central position on the European grid and has  many  interconnections 
with neighbouring countries : the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain and 
Switzerland. France  is a net exporter of electricity, thanks to its high share of nuclear 
generation. It exported 75.1  TWh of electricity in 2014 (around 13% of total generation),  
the highest level since 2002 when France exported 80.7  TWh. Exports were directed to 
the United Kingdom ( 21.2%), Italy (20.7%), Germany (19.7%), Belgium (15%), Switzerland 
(13.8%) , Spain (7.9%) and Luxembourg (1.5%).   0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500

121 Total imports amounted to  7.9 TWh  in 2014  versus 11.7  TWh in 2013, but came back to 
their level in 2015, largely thanks  to mild weather, low fossil fuel prices and high er 
availability of nuclear plants .   
Electricity exchanges with Belgium were  largely affected by the unavailability of 
Belgium ’s nuclear capacity. France ’s export s to Belgium increased to 11.2  TWh in 2014, 
27.7% higher than in 2013. Export s to all neighbouring  countries increased. France 
exports to Spain two -thirds of the time and import s from Spain only  when generation of 
renewable energy in Spain is in excess  and results in low prices .  
On the other hand, imports from Germany  are increasing, notably to cover France’s 
winter consumption peaks an d to export Germany’s higher renewable energy 
production.

INSTITUTIONS  
The Ministry of Environment, Energy and the Sea ( Ministère de l' environnement, de 
l'energie et de la m er, MEEM ) and its energy directorate ha ve the lead responsibility for 
the formulation and implementation of energy and climate polic ies, including policies 
concer ning  the electricity market and security of electricity supply.  
Established in 2000, the Energy Regulatory Commission ( Commission de r égulation de 
l’énergie , CRE ) is the national regulatory authority in the e nergy sector , i.e. in gas and 
electricity  markets. CRE is responsible for ensuring open access to all transmission and 
distribution networks for both electricity  and gas. It approves transmission  and distribution  
tariffs and annual network investment plans . In Decem ber 2015 , CRE gained the 
competence to propose regulated tariffs in electricity,  in line with the new methodology, 
which was previously a  competence of the ministry . Already since  2014, CRE  has been 
responsible for proposing the price of regulated access to nuclear power (ARENH, see 
section below on wholesale markets). In the area of renewable energy, CRE is in charge of 
assessing public service expenses in the context of  the renewable s support scheme and 
the organisat ion of renewable energy tenders. It has also a number of obligations under 
the European legislation in the field of  energy (REMIT, Third Energy Package), including 
market monitoring, certification of the transmission system oper ator RTE  (Réseau de - 40- 20 0 20 40 60 80 100

approval of interconnection management rules , the examination of RTE’s investment plan 
(ten-year network development plan) and Europ ean projects of common interest . The 
independence and impartiality of CRE are established under the provisions of Article L 133 -
6 of the French Code of Energy, but some competences are not yet fully independent (in 
terms of budget and resources). The CRE is governed by two independent authorities : the 
board of six commissioners wh o are appointed for a period of six years, non- renewable, 
and the Committee for dispute settlement and sanctions, consisting of four  members . In 
2015, CRE had 124 staff members, 127 in 2016   and it has been decided to increase the 
maximum number of full -time- equivalent  (FTE) by 22 FTE in 2017. CRE’s budget is 
submitted by MEEM and the Ministry of Finance to Parliament through the Finance Law. Resources have decreas ed in recent years : in 2015 CRE ’s budget was EUR  18.7 million, 
down from 19.9  million in 2009, despite its  many new mandates under the Energy 
Transition for Green Growth Act, the NOME Act of 2010 and EU legislation.  
INDUSTRY STRUCTURE  
Électricité de France (EDF)  is a key player in the French market, with a shareholding of 
French state and a largely vertically  integrated structure. EDF operates all nuclear reactors 
in France  and large parts of hydro generation . It has shareholdings in transmission (RTE) 
and distribution (Enedis), the la tter hold ing 95% of mainland’s concessions for electricity 
distribution and supply ing final consumers. Next to EDF, at retail level, about 80 companies 
have a buy and resell authorization ( autorisation d’achat pour revente ), including 20 so -
called alternative suppliers to end-consumers.  
The state is a key investor in the French electricity industry, with shareholdings in EDF 
(84.5%) and in AREVA (87%). The government decided to split AREVA NP (nuclear plants) 
and AREVA NA (new Areva) . EDF will take over AREVA NP activities and the  government 
supports the  recapitalisation of  both companies  (through the sale of shares in Engie) . EDF 
is also about to sell a minority stake in RTE . In 2016, EDF took  investment decisions to 
finance  new reactors abroad (Hin kley P oint C in the U nited Kingdom , Turkey ’s Sinop  and 
Finland ’s Olkiluoto 3 ) and is faced with the decision a bout the lifetime extension of its fleet 
of reactors in France (the so -called Grand Carénage ). 
The Réseau de transport d’électricité ( RTE) operates, maintains and develops the French 
high -voltage electricity transmission network,  which is  the largest in Europe. RTE is 
responsible for maintaining the power balance and operational security of the electricity system, on the basis of consumption  and generation forecasts. RTE is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of the partially public -owned French generat or Électricité de France (EDF).  In 
2012, RTE was certified by CRE as independent transmission operator (ITO), referred to in 
Article 9(8)(b) of the EU E lectricity Directive. Under the compliance requirements of the 
ITO, RTE has adopted a transparency data platform, separated from EDF. Discussions are 
ongoing on the possible restructuring of RTE’s ownership.  
RTE operates a transmission network of 105 331 km of power lines  of over  50 kilovolts ( kV) 
on mainland France  and 4 7 cross -border lines  with neighbouring countries  (the United 
Kingdom , Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Italy and Spain). RTE ’s customers 
are 54 electricity producers, 258 industrial customers, 32  electricity distributors and 
135 traders and suppliers .

8. Electricity  
 
 
124 Since 1906, the local communities have acted  as electricity distribution organising 
authorities (Autorités organisatrices de la distribution d'énergie , AODEs ), and own the 
distribution networks, as regulated  in the French Energy Code Article L. 322-4. 
Communities can give the right of operation to a concession holder. For 95% of mainland 
France or 35 million c onsumers , Enedis (formerly Électricité Réseau Distribution France , 
ERDF ) is the concession holder of AODEs and operates 1.3 million km of distribution lines. 
Enedis is a wholly owned subsidiary of EDF. The remaining 5% of the national territory is 
served by so -called entreprises locales de distribution (ELDs).  There are 150  ELDs 
or distribution system operators in France: six  operate local networks in large cities 
(Électricité de Strasbourg Réseaux  (ESR), Gaz et Électricité de Grenoble, URM (ex U sine 
d’Électricité de Metz), SICAE de l’Oise, Géredis Deux -Sèvres and SRD (Sorégies) ), while the 
majority is very small and  has fewer than 100  000 consumers. Since 2006, France has 
encouraged the regional amalgamation of territorial collectivities and authorities with a 
population of 1 million inhabitants and their distribution organisations towards larger department corporations (syndicat départemental d' électricité ). 
WHOLESALE MARKETS  
MARKET  STRUCTURE  
The electricity wholesale (and retail) market remains highly concentrated.  EDF owns and 
operates all of the 63 GW of French nuclear power capacity. Hydropower resources ar e 
allocated in concessions (Box 8.1). EDF operates 80% of all hydropower f acilities (16  GW 
out of 25  GW), including all of pump storage hydro; the remainder of hydro is operated 
by E NGIE – through the Société Hydroélectrique du Midi (SHEM) and by the Compagnie 
nationale du Rhône  (CNR), a 49% subsidiary of ENGIE.  
While the generation and retail sectors are open to competition, in line with EU 
directives, actual competition on the generation side is  limited  to large consumers, as  
small consumers still have access to a regulated tariff, proposed by incumbent 
operators, besides  so-called market offers  proposed by all suppliers  (including the 
incumbent). EDF operated  91.5% of installed capacity, ENGIE 5.1% and Uniper 2.6% 
(CRE, 201 6). The Herfindahl- Hirschman index (HHI), a measure of market concentration, 
gives the French power market a high value. By owning all nuclear reactors, the historical 
national utility EDF has been able to dominate the French electricity market for a long time. In 2015, the HHI in production, including EDF , was 7318 versus 6346 in the final 
consumer market, indicating a very high concentration in both generation and supply  
(regulated tariffs have since then been phased out for large  and medium -sized 
consumers). Production outside EDF was concentrated on only a few competitive players 
(CRE, 2016) and had a HHI of 3628.  
With a view to promote competition in the French market and in response to a European  
Commission investigation, the New Market Organisation Act of 7 December 2010 (Loi sur 
la nouvelle organisation du m arché de l' électricité (NOME ), introduced regulated access  
to 25% of EDF’s nuclear fleet or a maximum of 100 TWh per year (Accès régulé à 
l'électricité nucléaire historique , ARENH ), which has been in place since July 2011  for 
every electricity supplier and should expire by 2025, if not renewed. Under the ARENH 
mechanism , all consumers in France can benefit from the competitively priced nuclear 
electricity, regardless of their supplier. EDF should provide alternativ e suppliers access to 
the electricity produced by EDF’s nuclear plants “ at cost”.

126 The ARENH price has been fixed at EUR 42 per MWh in  2012  and the CRE has revised the 
methodology in 2016, as the  fixed tariff is hardly used by industrial consumers . In the 
past years wholesale prices in France and Europe were below the level of ARENH 
(Figure  8.7).  
In its 2015 report, the French Competition Authority ( Autorité  de la concurrence ) called 
upon the government to decide as soon as possible on the phase -out or extension of 
ARENH beyond 2025 (Autorité  de la c oncurrence, 2015 ). The Authority concludes that 
ARENH has not met its objectives. The future of ARENH has significant implications on 
the state of competition in the French market, the amortisation cost  of the nuclear 
energy infrastructure and the end of regulated tariffs, which are calculated on the basis 
of the ARENH price.  
MARKET COUPLING  
The integration of the French electricity market with the regional electricity markets in 
Europe has continued. After the market coupling of Central West ern electricity markets, 
North West ern Europe (February 2014) and South  West ern Europe (May 2014) were 
coupled, and Italy and Slovenia  followed  (February 2015). The process cumulated in May 
2015 in the coupling of t he two regions (South  West ern Europe and North  West ern 
Europe), managed by the grid operators and power exchanges from the relevant member s tates, with a view to manage cross -border electricity flows in an optimal way 
and to smooth out price differences across the E uropean U nion .  
In May 2015, a new flow -based method for market coupling was introduced in Central 
West Europe (including France) to better account for renewable power flows in integrated cross -border electricity networks. The cross -border capacity between 
Germany- France and Belgium- France has increased in 2016 following flow -based market 
coupling in 2015. Equally, the integration of France with neighbouring intraday markets 
has increased (with Italy) over the past five years. In fact, wholesale  electricity prices 
have largely converged in Europe in recent years.  
WHOLESALE MARKET PRICE TRENDS  
Because of  declining demand and plummeting fossil fuel prices, average spot prices in 
France have been declining since 2008. They  dropped below EUR 30 per MWh in 2014 
before recovering again to an average value of around EUR 40 per MWh by the end of 
2015. In addition, high availability of nuclear power and the inflow of renewable 
electricity put additional downward pressure on price s. France had low wholesale 
electricity prices at the EPEX France,  which were  abov e the lowest prices in Europe 
depicted at  Nord  Pool and the German EPEX (Figure 8.7).  
Total annual amount of electricity (including brokered contracts) traded on the 
exchanges has increa sed significantly during 2009 -15; the futures market had the largest 
volume, while the intraday market is still relatively small. The bulk of the energy trade , 
however, takes place over the counter, reaching similar volumes as the futures market 
of around 800 TWh (CRE, 2016 ).

132 Despi te the theoretical market opening of 100%, 90% of residential consumers and 78% 
of small non -residential ones remained on regulated tariffs offered by the historic 
supplier as of 31 March 2016. Only 10% of the households have chosen  alternative 
suppliers. Conversely, 58% of large non -residential consumers had market offers from 
the historic supplier (versus 42% by alternative suppliers).  
In total, the share of regulated tariffs in the market has come down to 40% after their 
phase- out for large consumers (Figure 8.9).  
Supplier switching remains low and is limited to about 2% of non -residential consumers, 
around 1% of households  and 8% of large consumers in 2016 (CRE, 2016).  
The principle of reversibility allow s household consumers to change from regulated 
prices to market offers and vice -versa, without restriction.  
Under the NOME Law, a new calculation method for regulated tariffs was introduced on the basis of accumulated costs. Regulated tariffs are calculated by CRE as the sum of the 
cost of nuclear (ARENH purchase cost), the additional cost of alternative market offers, 
distribution and transmission charges , and EDF ’s marketing costs. This aims to make a 
gradual transition towards transparent pricing and  the phase- out of regulated prices , 
and to stimulat e the entry of alternative suppliers, while mitigating the price increase in 
the transition to market prices. When market prices are above the nuclear costs, alternative suppliers can purchase nuclear electricity from EDF at cost (ARENH price of 
EUR 42 per  MWh) and thus compete with EDF. However, with decreasing wholesale 
prices (Figure 8.7) below the nuclear cost, most suppliers no longer purchase from EDF 
but from the wholesale market and charge mark -ups to final consumers.  
The French government has not yet set out plans on how to abolish regulated household 
tariffs. However, regulated tariffs are calculated on the basis of the ARENH price and are 
there fore tied to its duration. ARENH is set as a temporary measure under French law 
and should expire by 31 December 2025.  
PRICE TRENDS  
Final electricity p rices have remained fairly stable over the last  five years, with some 
increase for industry and decrease for households, but not comparable to the major increase in industry prices which occurred during 2005 -10 (Figure 8 .10). 
By international comparison, France has electricity prices for households and industry 
around the IEA median, thanks to nuclear and hydro -based electricity generation.   
However, electricity prices are heavily taxed; the energy cost component is rather low and transmission/distribution charges (Tarif d'utilisation des réseaux publics d'é lectricité, 
TURPE) are added.  The tax component is 34% for households and 22% for industry 
customers (Figure 8. 11) as in France, because electricity prices carry a number of public 
service charges.

136 mechanism where capacity obligations are traded between electricity capacity providers 
(e.g. generators or demand side operators) and electricity suppliers. Capacity providers offer capacity when demand is highest,  for example during extreme winter conditions. In 
return for their available electricity capacity they receive certificates. Suppliers need to purchase certificates from capacity providers in order to cover the peak demand of their 
customers. These certificates can either be traded bilaterally between providers and 
suppliers or through regularly organised public auctions. The capacit y market is going to 
start on 1  Januar y 2017.  
POWER SYSTEM ADEQUAC Y 
The French electricity mix has a low diversity and high baseload thanks to  the dominance 
of nuclear (78%) and hydro  (10%) in the mix. Despite having a largely decarbonised 
power generation, there are a number of challenges related to power system  adequacy, 
such as  the ageing nuclear fleet with requirements for shut -downs during more frequent 
maintenance and safety upgrades, lower water availability  in hydro basins in dry years , 
reduced flexibility from thermal plants following the closure of oil and coal -fired powe r 
plants, and decreasing peak-demand response capacity in recent years . These impacts 
are only partially offset by  increasing shares of variable renewable electricity.  
On the demand side, France has seen a large decline in electricity (industrial) demand,  
with the relocation of industry and  the impact of energy efficiency and the economic 
slowdown. Forecasts expect a flat electricity -demand curve in the coming decade with a 
maximum of 1% increase per year. (The share of nuclear in the electricity mix would  
actually increase if electricity consumption declined in the coming years, which would not be in line with the target of the government.) 
The main risk for security of supply is the thermo- sensi tivity of the demand and the peak 
load during cold snaps . In winter periods electricity consumption is very sensitive to 
temperature (+2.4 GW/°C ) owing to the high penetration of electric heating . Peak load 
demand has increased 2.5 times faster than the average demand during the last 10 
years . Peak demand hit the 100 GW for the first time in 2012. G rowth in peak demand 
has however declin ed since. With the deployment of  electric vehicles, peak demand is 
expected to rise again to 100 GW in the period to 2020, but consumption from electric 
heaters could find itself  replaced by electric vehicles.  
Peak demand -response capacity  has actually been reduced by more than 50% in the past 
decade. Demand- response capacity fell from 6  GW in 2000 to 2. 8 GW in 2014, as 
regulated, dynamic tariffs are being gradua lly phased -out. Therefore, the  draft PPE 
stipulates that d emand response should be i n the order of 5 GW up to  2018 and 6 GW 
for 2023.  
The availability of French generation is usu ally good, with large baseload and only a low 
portion of variable electricity from renewable energy sources in  the mix. N uclear and 
hydro need stable water basin levels. In recent years, however, France experiences 
increasing water scarcity amid the rise in temperatures and recurring heat waves. At the same time, the share of backup plants from fossil -fuel capacities has decreased in recent 
years. Around 10 coal units (or 3.3  GW) were phased out during 2012-1 6. In 2016,  EDF 
announced plans to shut down its entire fuel oil- fired power fleet by 2018, which 
corresponds to a total capacity of 5.2 GW.  While the construction of new  gas-fired 
power plants  (combined cycle gas turbines , CCGTs) continued,  current market conditions

137 lead  to limited availability. There are only two  main thermal plants under construction or 
planned during the next years are the CCGT s of Bouchain (2016) and Landivisiau (2018).  
Traditionally, the French power system has been characterised by a structural 
overcapacity following the nuclear programme which saw the  construction of a large 
fleet of 58 nuclear reactors during the 1970 -80s (the oldest reactor is Fessenheim, built 
in 19 78). France has enjoyed an “overabundance” of electricity supply, due to the 
combined effects of sluggish demand and low growth of renewable energy. However, as 
explained in Chapter 10 on Nuclear E nergy, the French nuclear power plant fleet is 
ageing, as t he plants were  built in the same timeframe and are approaching 30 years 
average age. In the longer term, the ageing nuclear fleet presents an enormous financial 
and organisational challenge for the main owner and operator EDF and the French 
government, as well as for the electricity market in terms of securing the electricity 
supplies at competitive prices. Project delays in Flamanville could compromise the 
possibility to replace Fessenheim with the new European pressurised water reactor 
(EPR ). The closure date of Fessenheim has been decided in 2016 and should take place in 
2018 (the plant will reach 40 years in 2019)  and EDF has been offered a compensation 
payment of EUR 400 million.  
In addition, there are systemic risks linked to the fact  that most plants  have the same 
design and if the design fails, then a range of reactors could have  to close for inspections. 
This situation has actually occurred in the winter 2016 -17 (see the assessment of the 
short -term adequacy in Box 8.2).  It remains uncertain which plants are  expected to be 
extended or shut down. Under French nuclear safety regulations, the authorisation for  
extending a plant’s  lifetime is granted by the French Nuclear S afety Authority (ASN) for a 
period of 10 years only following a review of the safety of the  entire capacity level with 
the same  nuclear design (palier). By end of 2018/early 2019, ASN is expected to give a 
general notice on  the possibil ity to extend the lifetime of a share of the reactors by 
another 10 years ; however, final safety a pprovals need to be given plant by plant.   
Under the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act of 2015, the government set out 
ambitions to decrease the share of nuclear  in electricity generation to 50% by 2025 and 
increase the share of renewable energy to 40% in the power mix  by 2030 . This means 
that within 10 years, all conditions the same, France has to replace the remainder (78%  -
 50%  = 28%) by renewable energies (assuming that the hydro potential has been reached 
and that new CCGTs are not economic), which also shall increase to 40% by 2030.  The 
closure of Fessenheim alone will not reduce the share of nuclear to 50% by 2025.  
Most of the new capacities are renewable energy sources, mainly wind power and solar 
PV. Wind power growth had slowed because of regulatory uncertainty and an 
unfavourable economic climate but is showing signs of recovery. Concerning PV, robust 
global expansion has driven production costs down considerably in recent years: 
significant efforts have been made to reduce the cost of sol ar panels, and the focus now 
is on increasing productivity by targeting costs associated with installation, civil 
engineering and inverters and other equipment. A large share of new solar photovoltaic 
projects is being developed through tenders organised by the regulator CRE. The 
objectives of installed capacity for renewable energy sources are defined in the PPI 
(programmation pluriannuelle de l’investissement)  and have been included in the PPE 
(programmation pluriannuelle de l’ énergie ) for the period 2016- 23. The PPE gives 
visibility concerning the development of renewables, which, as a no -regret measure , will 
continue to be strongly supported and will contribute to achieve the reduction of the share of nuclear energy in the e lectricity mix to 50% by 2025.

138 With regard to the closure of the Fessenheim nuclear power plant, the objective of the 
PPE is to repeal the authorisation to exploit the plant by 2016. Only the next PPE will 
include a forecas t with regard to nuclear energy, based on the ASN review in 20 18. 
In addition, supplies to France from neighbouring countries during peak s may  be 
compromised by the situation in Belgium (extended unavailability of a portion of the 
Belgian nuclear fleet increase ), lower imports from the Netherlands/Germany to 
Belgium) , and the general retirement of old plants in the region or their placement in 
strategic reserves (in Germany  and Austria). France already imports from Germany in 
winter peak periods.  
The 2015 RTE adequacy outlook  (RTE, 2015b) alerted to reduced margins at peak load  in 
the winters towards 2020, because of growing uncertainties linked to the  large amount 
of nuclear plants under maintenance  and possibl e decommissioning of coal/oil/gas 
power plants  and growing concern about security of supply  at times of peak demand. 
RTE does not guarantee that it is able to fulfill the security -of-supply standard (loss of 
load expectation <= 3 hours) in all scenarios. Increasing flexibility is also needed to cope 
with i) intermittent renewable energies , and ii) rising pe ak demand, while the real value 
of flexibility is not yet fully recognised. Therefore, the government decided to introduce a capacity mechanism by ministerial decree in January 2015, as described above. The 2015 report illustrated the decreasing capacity m argins during all winters up to 2019 -20, 
as demand peak s increase (though at lower growth rates) while peak generation 
decreases every year and baseload coal or gas -fired power plants were closed in 2013 -
15. The 2015 report  takes also into account generation adequacy in neighbouring 
countries’ interconnections and assesses various risk scenarios up to 2020. A regional 
generation adequacy assessment, based on a  shared methodology among TSOs was 
presented in the framework of the Pentalateral Energy Forum in M arch 2015.  
Import capacity is necessary for France to maintain its security of supply. Without 
interconnections, which contribute about 10 GW over the coming years, France would 
not be able to maintain its balance  during peak hours, as can be seen in Table 8.2.

 limiti ng flood damage.  
The final objective for the  extreme weather plan is to ensure that 90% of customers are 
reconnected in fewer than five  days, as was the case during the storms  in 1999 and 
2009.  The PPE covers all investment s, including network investment. At the same time, 
the territorial and regional authorities have to adopt energy and climate plans which will include investment s in renewable energies and energy efficiency.  At the moment, the 
PPE does neither reflect those t erritorial and regional investment plans nor  their impact 
on the transmission investment plan by RTE.  
Box 8.2  Security of electricity supply in the winter 2016 -17  
In the winter 2016 -17, France is experiencing electricity supply constraints mainly due 
to unprecedented unavailability of nuclear generation. In case of a temperature much 
colder than average, ensuring security of supply in the coming winter could be 
challenging. The French nuclear safety authority (ASN) required the extension of the 
planned maintenance period and the additional brief shutdown of several nuclear 
reactors in the winter to test for possible safety issues (involving excessive level of 
carbon in the steel of the steam generators).  
RTE considers that the development of renewable energies, import capacity, demand 
response and energy efficiency will enable to compensate the decrease of nuclear 
generation. In 2016, t otal inst alled capacity in France reached  126 GW, two times the 
installed nuclear capacity  (63 GW) . Hydro capacity in France is 25 GW but the level of 
water in the reservoirs is at its lowest over the last 10 years. Wind capacity is 10.3 GW 
and its statistical average of load factor in winter is 30%. Solar PV capacity reaches 6.2 
GW, but this capacity is not generating during the evening peak that takes place at 
19h00 in winter. Conventional capacity (gas, coal and oil) reaches 22.5 GW  in 2016. 
The availability is good as only one coal unit is currently under long term maintenance 
work until 9 January 2017.  
However, electricit y import capacity has been lower than expected, with a tight 
situation in the United Kingdom and Belgium (where nuclear reactors Doel 3 and 
Tihange 1 are shutdown).  French nuclear safety  authority ASN confirmed that 
7 reactors will come back on line before  the end of 2016 . The situation in Belgium is 
considered to be less challenging in the winter 2016 -17. The Belgian  TSO arranged for 
some 750 MW of strategic reserves, which can be activated for economic and security 
reasons,  and relies on the possibility to increase  interconnection capacity from 
3 500 MW to 4 500 MW and has brought online one  nuclear plant of 1 000 MW , 
following maintenance work . 
On 8 November 2016, RTE published its adequacy analysis for the winter 2016 -17 
(RTE, 2016b). Peak demand is expected for January 2017. If temperatures fall 3°C 
below the average, RTE may have to gradually implement emergency measures.

141 Box 8.2  Security of  electricity supply in the winter 2016 -17 (continued)  
The first step would be interrupting 21 energy -intensive industrial sites and 
volunteers to reduce the power demand by 1.5 GW. RTE could then reduce voltage by 
5% or 4 GW of load, without interrupting supply. In the case of an extreme imbalance 
between consumption and production, RTE could finally perform load -shedding 
through ‘programmed and momentary outages’ in a rotational basis of less than two 
hours per consumer while preserving supply to sensitive  loads and priority customers, 
such as hospitals and important industries.  
The Minister for Environment, Energy and Marine Affairs,  Segolène Royal announced 
the launch of a national campaign on the behaviors and tools to reduce electricity 
consumption in winter. RTE has a citizen alert system in place to allow consumer 
participation in alleviating supply tightness during peak periods (éCO2mix). It 
broadcast alerts via smartphones, tablet computers, and the RTE  website with the aim 
to encourage consumers to reduce their consumption by deferring the usage of 
appliances to off -peak hours, lowering the room temperature by 1° -2°C before leaving 
home and turning off lights in empty rooms.  
ASSESSMENT  
France holds the  second- highest installed capacity for nuclear (63 GW)  and nuclear 
generation among IEA member countries  (after the United States). It  has the world’s 
highest share of nuclear in its electricity mix (78%). France is  Europe 's leading electricity 
exporter to neighbouring countries, with the except ion of  Germany , from which France 
imports .  
Domestic  electricity demand is declin ing, notably because of  decreasing industrial 
activity and energy efficiency gains. However, peak demand has been  on the rise. The 
French electricity market is characterised by an intense peak demand, notably during 
winters ; electricity consumption is very sensitive to temperature (+2. 4 GW/°C). Because 
of the high p enetration of electric heating, peak load demand increased 2. 5 times faster 
than the average demand during the last 10 y ears . However, the growth of the peak load 
is now decreasing  and is more in line with  the grow th of the average demand.  
Since the last in -depth review in 2009, the government has taken several steps to deal 
with three main challenges : i) phase out regulat ed tariffs (for large  and medium -sized  
consumers), reform regulated tariffs (for small consumers) to ensure their contestability , 
and tackle EDF’s near- monopoly (84.5% state -owned), ii) ensure that electricity security 
covers the winter peak demand through the introduction of a capacity market and 
demand- response management (DRM) and iii)  continue to increase electricity market 
integration and interconnections of France with the rest of the U nion , notably Spain.   
Despite having a target of reducing the share of nuclear in the power mix from 78% to 
50% by 2025, the government has not been able so far to set out pathways and 
scenarios for the future of nuclear energy in France, pending decisions with regard to the closure or lifetime extension from the French Nuclear Safety Authority . The financing of 
the Grand Carénage  is currently not secured, as the ARENH mechanism does not provide 
the necessary revenues to EDF, since wholesale electricity prices have been largely 
below the ARENH price in recent years. This fact adds to significant uncertainty for the 
French electricity sector and the energy transition . Without creating more competition 
and thereby enlarging the investment base for both nuclear and renewable energy,  the

142 government may face substantial financing issues. The government should evaluate the 
cost and benefits of nuclear power and renewable energy  within the forthcoming 
investment plans and assess the potential impact on security of electricity supply in 
France and in the neighbouring countries (which are almost all closing down nuclear 
capacity).  
WHOLESALE ELECTRICIT Y MARKET  
The French wholesale electricity market remains highly concentrated,  as nuclear and 
hydropower assets are owned by incumbent EDF. Regulated access to EDF’s nuclear fleet is allowed to  25% or 100 TWh through the new ARENH mechanism. On the other hand, 
France is participating in the market integration process with other European countries in a more and more integrated  European electricity market.  
Since the last IEA in- depth review in 2009, in response to the European Commission 
investigation, the government introduced the regulated tariff for access to historic nuclear energy (ARENH) under the NOME L aw. The IEA welcome s this, as it partly 
improves access for alternative suppliers; however its implementation can be adjusted. 
The quantity of ARENH supplied in 2015 has largely decreased as spot market prices are 
below the ARENH fixed tariff (EUR 42 per MWh).  
In the context of low wholesale prices, some actors feared that ARENH prices may have 
adverse effect s on the market (“arenhisation of prices”), developing from a ceiling price 
to a floor price. However, wholesale prices are now significantly below the ARENH which 
is not a floor but still provides protection to all suppliers in case of a rise in prices. New suppliers are obliged to get guarantees, to pay in advance and to maintain the level of purchase (monotony clause) which could hamper fair competition and  thus lead t o out -
of-market decisions.  
The Energy Transition  for Green Growth Act has a number of opportunities to open the 
market to new competitors. Next to hydropower and renewable energy, the role of demand aggregators will be important in delivering services and, as a consequence,  in 
introducing competition in the retail market. As for  generation, new capacities and the 
decrease of nuclear share could imply new market players. The review team encourages the government to swiftly create an open market place in France with a view to make the energy transition a success.  
As part of the Energy Transition  for Green Growth  Act, the government has announced it 
will renew the hydropower concessions. The vast majority of France’s hydro plants (80%) 
are run by EDF, the rem aining 20% by subsidiaries of ENGIE . The lack of access to the 
hydro capacities reinforces the dominant position of the incumbent , providing an 
advantage in terms of reserves and ancillary services, but also in the forthcoming 
capacity market and the renewable energy market. However, the Act does not provide 
for the full opening of the existing concessions ; instead it creates the possibility to 
prolong the existing concessions through exemptions for refurbishment work and for the set-up of public- private partnerships. The IEA believes that the renewal of hydropower 
concessions would need to encompass all hydropower plants, and should make investment/refurbishment needs part of the concession contract, with a view to improve 
competition on the wholesale market and foster security of supply to cover peak demand in France.

143 With regard to security of electricity supply, the 2014 generation adequacy assessment 
by RTE identified a deficit of capacity, notably in the winter 2017 /18, due  to nuclear 
capacity maintenance and the closure of fossil fuel -fired power plants.  The assessment 
for the period 2015 -20 reveals a positive margin on the baseline scenario, taking also 
into account the expected closure of the Fessenheim power plant while at the same time 
the new EPR nuclear reactor of Flamanville (2018 -19) and two new CCGTs , and the 
contribution of imports from other countries. 
The new capacity mechanism aims to deal with winter peak load and to improve security 
of supply. Registration of capacities has started in  2015 (with delivery starting on 
1 January 2017). Both generation (old and new) and demand- side market players can 
participate as providers. Its aim is to ensure that the security of supply is met , because 
the risk of lo sing load expectation for 3 hours equals  30 hours every 10 years  in France, 
as defined by the TSO and approved by the government. France has opted for a 
“decentralised” capacity mechanism .  
The implementation of the capacity mechanism is a learning process for all actors, with a 
number of open questions on how capacity reserves held abroad, and thus 
interconnection capacity , can be taken into account and how the level of the estimated 
peak capacity will need to evolve over time. EDF is likely to be a dominant actor on the new capacity market, so it will be important to remain vigilant that fair competition 
conditions be applied for alternative suppliers.  
After an inquiry in 2016 , the European Commission has required France to introduce 
significant changes of the model chosen (capacity market) in order to ensure that the 
mechanism is inclusive of capacities located across the borders and does not put in a 
disadvantage new entrants.  
For the coming years, an important role f or demand response is expected in order to 
meet peak demand, provide flexibility, and deal with increasing renewable targets. This 
role is expected to be based o n market mechanisms (explicit DR) instead of being based 
on tariffs (implicit DR ), so that consumers benefit from lower electricity prices. Pilot 
projects are being carried out to test the response of demand. In the short term, and in 
addition to DR, the integration of renewable energy sources  must be encouraged 
through the different markets (d ay-ahead, balancing, ancillary services). In this regard, 
developments at European  level on the new energy market design will be taken into 
account by France.  
ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS  
Implementing the EU Third Internal Energy P ackage, France has opted for the ITO model  
(independent t ransmission operator) which means that RTE  owns  and operates the 
assets as the sole TSO in France, while it remains part of  the vertically integrated 
company (EDF), with special rules to guarantee its independence.  
At the distribution level, 95% of the network is operated by EDF’s ERDF distribution 
system operator, recently rebranded Enedis. Local distribution companies (around 150) 
are responsible for public service electricity distribution over appro ximately 5% of 
mainland France, and have different network rules . The main rules are set at the 
national level by secondary legislation and decisions of the regulator.  
Since the  last in-depth review in  2009, the  energy regulatory authority CRE has further 
developed its competences. CRE approves the transmission network investment plan

146 the reversibility option . Price comparison tools and switching campaigns can be useful in 
this regard. The government, the regulator or the energy o mbudsman should encourage 
regular switching campaigns, such as th ose carried out in Germany or the Netherlands. 
However, existing measures are not sufficient to foster competition, despite progres s 
made in oblig ing EDF to provide consumption data to alternative suppliers.  Data quality 
provided by the incumbent supplier still needs to be improved. The number of 
consumers switching supplier remains very low. The challenges are complex: preserving 
the privacy of consumers, while ensuring market players and operators have open 
access to anonymous end -use information and data on prices, costs, consumption and 
investments in energy and energy efficiency for all classes of consumers. Ensuring that 
consumers have free access to their own data, effective comparative information, and 
that data security and privacy are all managed by independent data providers  as 
important component s of retail market regulation. The review of the actual performance 
of retail energy billing, meter reading and accurate charging  of consumption is crucial.  
Today, distribution network concessions are largely held by Enedis. In the near future, 
between 2018 and 2028, the  distribution concessions with Enedis will be renewed in a 
numbe r of cities and regions.  DSO  regulation, codes and rules for access to the various 
regional small distribution networks and to the large Enedis network would benefit to all 
actors and en hance access for independent retailers and  open competition . The roll-out 
of one smart -meter technology  (Enedis’ s Linky smart meter) by 2021 may take too long 
and could become a  technology lock -in, as global metering devices are innovative and 
improve fast. This can create a barrier for switching and consumer choice.  
Given the transformation of the demand -side and retail markets in the future with a 
growing use of solar PV and distributed generation as well as smart meters, there is an 
opportunity for improving consumers’  engagement and facilitating retail market 
compet ition. The European Union is discussing the future electricity market design which 
includes measures to foster independent DSOs that can support data management, 
smart metering and support the market as neutral facilitator. France should examine 
these opportunities and adapt its retail market in step with its energy transition.  
RECOMMENDATIONS  
The government of France should: 
 Promote competition by opening up concessions for hydropower facilities under the 
Energy Transition for Green Growth Act , and by remaining vigilant that fair 
competition is applied in  the capacity mechanism for alternative and foreign 
suppliers. 
 Take measures to ensure that the costs of the energy transition are minimised and 
allocated fairly and equitably across customer categories ; and complete the revision 
of the energy -climate taxation.  
 Promote a co -ordinated approach to energy planning at different levels, ensuring 
consistency and efficiency of network plans with  the pluriannual energy 
programm ing and in the regional renewable ene rgy plans. Continue t o support cross -
border electricity interconnection projects, notably by  streamlining the permitting 
process.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND  
Renewable energy plays a small but growing  role in France ’s energy mix as  total primary 
energy supply (TPES) from renewable sources has increased by 35.4 % over the past 
decade to  2015 , from 16.7  million  tonnes of oil -equivalent ( Mtoe ) to 22.6 Mtoe or 9.2 % 
of France ’s tota l primary energy supply (TPES) in 2015 . Biofuels and waste are the main 
renewable source s with 15.1  Mtoe or 6.1 % of TPES in 2015. Hydropower represent ed 
4.7 Mtoe or 1.9 % of TPES followed by wind power (1.8  Mtoe or 0.7 % of TPES ), solar 
power (0.8  Mtoe or 0. 3% of TPES) and marginal amount s of geothermal energy 
(0.2 Mtoe or 0.1%) (Figure 9. 1).

150 Over the last ten years, biofuels and waste grew at a 2.4% annualised rate  and slightly 
increased their share in TPES from 4.4% to 6.1%. S olar grew from a negligible level at an 
annualised rate of 27.8 % to a small share of 0.3%  in TPES, while wind energy increased 
to 0.7% at an annualised growth rate  of 36.2 %, depicting the fastest technology growth.  
Installed renewable electricity generation capacity surged from 26 6 39 megawatts ( MW) 
to 41  858 MW over the decade 2004 to  2014 (Table 9.1). Hydropower has remained the 
dominant source in renewable power but its capacity has remained stable, showing a 
small  0.8% increase. Solar power grew to 5 654  MW from negligible levels  in 2004. 
During the same  period, wind power surged in capacity from 358  MW to 9  068 MW. 
Wind capacity advanced at 38.2% per annum or by a factor of 25 over ten years to  
9 068 MW in 2014. However, exploitation of offshore wind has not started.

Electricity generated from renewable sources amounted  to 91.8 terawatt- hours (TWh) in 
2015, or 16.3% of total generation  (Figure  9.3). During the last  10 years, it has increased 
by 58.3%, from 58 TWh  in 2005. Renewable  electricity generation comprises hydro 
(54.9 TWh or 9.7% ), wind ( 21.2 TWh or 3.8% ), biofuels and waste (7.3 TWh or 1.3%) and 
solar (8.4 TWh or 1.5%).  
By international comparison, France is slightly below the IEA median when looking at the 
share of renewables in TPES . It is the eleventh- lowest  among 29 IEA member countries, 
behind the Czec h Republic and followed by Ireland (see Figure 9. 2). Its share of biofuels 
and waste is  the fifteenth- highest, while the share of hydro is fourteenth-highest.

152 Energy Management Agency (ADEME)  supports project developers, citizens and policy 
makers with analysis, information and fi nancial support (notably the re newable heat 
fund and waste fund), including on research, development and demonstration of energy 
technologies.  
The Regulatory Commission of Ener gy (CRE)  oversees the French electricity and gas 
markets and ensures the right of access to all electricity and gas transmission and 
distribution networks from suppliers to customers. In the area of renewable energy, CRE  
administers the public service contributions, which are used to cover renewable s 
support. I t organises the call for tenders in co -operation with the electricity network 
operators and the renewable energy generators.  
POLICIES AND MEASURES  
PROGRESS TO 2020  
France has an obligation to reach a share of 23% renewable energy in  gross final energy 
consumption1 by 2020 pursuant to EU D irective 2009/28/EU, with a sector split of 27% 
share of renewables in electricity, 33% in heating and cooling and 10.5% in transport2 as 
detailed in  its National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) of 2010. The overall 23% 
target has also been  enshrined in the Energy Transition  for Green Growth  Act of 2015  
(Loi relative à la transition énergé tique pour la croissance verte, LTECV ).  
Progress so far shows a positive trend with total renewable energy in gross final 
consumption growing from 9% in 2009 to 14.6% in 2014, slightly below the interim 
target for 2014 of 16% of gross final consumption. Looking at consumption, by 2014, 
France had reached a share of renewable energy of 18.3%  in electricity , 17.8% in  heat 
and 7.8%  in transport . By 2014, progress towards the targets was unevenly distributed 
among technologies. France has overshot its targets for solar PV, as the technology costs 
have come down significantly (the 2016 solar PV tenders resulted in bid prices between 
EUR 80/MWh  and EUR 70/MWh). To date, wind power is not on track, and the plan to 
install large- scale wind capacity offshore has yet to materialise. Biomass has seen strong 
additions in the heating and transport sectors , thanks to the  improvement of the rmal 
performances of buildings and improved use of biomass  in co -generation. In heating and 
cooling, France was  far from the proposed 2020 targets.  This lag in relation to heat ing 
and cooling is due in part to the fact that 2014 was the hottest recorded year in decades. 
In France, there is a strong correlation between the severity of the winter and the share 
of biomass in final consumption  (and domestic biomass consumption is not corrected for 
climate variations  in line with Eurostat). 
Future growth is expected to come from wind in electricity and solid biomass in heat, as well as biofuels and electric vehicles in the transport sector (MEDDE, 2014 ; NREAP, 
2010). The objectives for each renewable technology have been revised in Ap ril 2016 in 
the context of the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act  and the pluriannual 
investment plan (PPI), taking into account the real development of installed capacities 
since the elaboration of the NREAP.

153 Renewable electricity  
Up to 2016, renewable electricity has been supported by means  of a feed -in-tariff paid 
by the electricity consumers through a tax on  final  electricity consumption, the so -called 
contribution to electricity public service (c ontribution au service public de l’électricité , 
CSPE). With its proceeds, the public mission bank (Caisse  des Dépôts  et Consignations, 
CdC) compensated EDF and local distribution companies that had an obligation to buy 
renewable electricity at a regulated price (feed -in tariff) from renewable energy 
producers. Around 64% of CSPE contributed to the s upport of renewable electricity; 
7.5% of CSPE supported com bined heat and power generation and the remainder was 
allocated to the price equalisation in overseas territories and the so -called “ social 
tariffs”. In 2015, the cost of the CSPE amounted to EUR 19.5 per MWh or 12% of the 
electricit y bill of an average household. The CSPE costs were only levied on electricity 
consumers , and not on other fossil fuel sources (petrol, diesel or gas).

* Other  includes geothermal, hydro and municipal waste incineration. 
Source: CRE.  
 
As of 2010, CSPE contributions had to cover rising costs, mainly due to overshooting 
solar PV support through feed -in-tariffs ( FIT), as illustrated in  Figure 9. 4. Before  2010, 
CSPE revenues failed to increase at the  same  pace as the costs of the support scheme 
(the CSPE was capped at an annual electricity price increase of maximum EUR 3 per 
MWh), resulting in the accumulation of a EUR 6 billion  debt for EDF .  
The renewable energy component  in the CSPE increased from EUR 580 m illion  in 2009 to 
over EUR 3.2 billion in 2013 an d EDF accumulated a deficit. I n 2010 , an automatic 
increase of the unit contribution was introduced so as to progressively catch up with 
expenses and to fully reimburse the debt  by 2018.  Forecasts by the regulator CRE had 
indicated that the CSPE renewable energy component would reach a level of EUR 
8 billion in 2025 .  
The government introduced cuts in the subsidies, some of them retroactive, to avoid further overshooting of the deployment targets, notably for solar PV, as technology 
costs were coming down rapidly, and could avoid an even higher deficit, which other countries have experienced , for instance Spain or Portugal.   01 0002 0003 0004 0005 0006 0007 0008 0009 000

154 REFORM AND 2030 TARG ETS  
The Energy Transition for Green Growth Act sets ambitious targets for renewable 
energy: France now commits to reaching a share of 32% in the energy mix  by 2030 at 
national level. Renewable energy sources will need to represent 40% of electricity 
generation, 38% of heat consumption, 15% in the transport sector and 10% of gas 
consumption.  
The Act also required the r eform of the CSPE, which needed to be aligned to EU state aid 
guidelines and new cost curves for technology development. In 2015, the government 
set in motion the reform of the support scheme for 1 January 2016 onwards.  
The government reformed the CSPE under the revised Finance Law 2015. Public service 
expenses are now included in the s tate budget . The new CSPE committee  is charged to  
monitor the evolution of public service expenses, including pluriannual programming . In 
2016, the CSPE budget in support of  renewable energy is allocated to a dedicated energy 
transition item, while other general public services are covered by  a new public mission 
budget of the s tate. Social tariffs are to be phased out and replaced by energy vouchers.  
A more robust energy taxation framework will be created in 2017 (see Figure 9. 5). The 
CSPE renewable s support contribution will be merged with the excise tax on electricity 
(taxe intérieure sur la consommation f inale d’ électricité, TICFE) and, which enlarge the 
tax base and bring the support under Parliamentary control. In line with EU g uidelines on 
state aid for environmental protection and energy 2014 -20, the Energy Transition  for 
Green Growth Act amended the French Energy Code (Article 104) and re quired that the 
reform of support policies for renewable electricity promote direct marketing with feed -
in premium along the following elements: 
 Since 1 January 2016, large -scale and mature renewable electricity technologies 
need to be tendered (direct marketing) with a feed- in premium to complement the 
market price (complement de remuneration). Tenders are organised for new large -
scale biomass (above 300 kW), biogas (above 500 kW), solar PV (above 500 kW) and offshore wind. For new onshore wind and all sma ll-scale faciliti es, the FIT continues 
to apply, sometimes through tenders (solar PV). According to the EU state aid guidelines (EEAG), some technologies are exempted from tenders and benefit from direct feed -in premium (energy from waste and geothermal en ergy).  
 Simplification of permit procedures through administrative deadlines which require the permitting and connection of renewable power facilities of up to 18 months for 
large -scale facilities and 2 months for facilities of less than 3 kW, with penalties for 
non-compliance. For wind, hydro and biogas facilities , a streamlined permitting 
procedure (single permit) should become the default.  
 Financial participation (shareholdings) of local communities and municipalities in 
private companies investing in re newable energy generation projects. 
 Simplification of the tender procedure in order to reduce the timing of the 
procedure and to facilitate its application. 
A transitory arrangement is in place for facilities that applied for the F IT before t he 
Energy Transition for Green Growth Act was passed and that can deploy their facilities 
within 18 months. Existing facilities can also choose to switch to the market premium 
(from FI T), but they can only return to F IT within three years.

155 Figure 9. 5  Reform of the  financing of renewable energy  (ENR)   
 
 
The expansion of renewable energy technologies is managed through the pluriannual 
programming  of investments ( programmation pluriannuelle des investissements, PPI ). 
The 2009 PPI was revised and a new one  presented in April 2016 which establishes 
deployment targets up to 2023 with interim targets for 2018.  Taking stock of the delays 
in the deployment of wind power, especially offshore  (where France has lost ground), 
and the more rapid than expected cost reduction of solar photovoltaics,  the PPI  slightly 
postpones the target for wind but increases that for solar, from 5  400 MW in 20 18 to 
10 200 MW in 2020 and to 20  200 MW by 2023. In comparison, in 2008, France had a 
target of 6 GW offsho re wind and 19 MW onshore wind for the year 2020.

156 The PPI was published ahead of the new pluriannual p rogramm ing for the energy sector 
(progammation pluriannualle de l’énergie, PPE ), developed under the Energy Transition 
for Green Growth Act as the main governance tool to evaluate and control target 
progress. The first PPE was adopted as law  on 27  October 2016, which reflects the 
targets of the PPI.  
France has changed its support mechanism. In May 2016, two implementing regulations 
(Decrees 2016 -682 and 2016- 691) were adopted to detail the reforms. Regulation 
2016 -682 establishes the new mechanism of feed- in premium (complément de 
rémunération), while Decree 2016 -691 contains the list of renewable energy facilities 
eligible for the market premium.  
Figure 9.6  The new renewable support scheme ( direct marketing with market premium) in France  
 
 
For small -scale renewable energy technologies, addit ional  technology- specific decrees 
will be published which will set out the contract lengths and reference values for each 
technology, as submitted to the regulator CRE ex -ante (see Figure 9 .6). Decreasing 
reference values might be allowed, depending on the  speed of development of each 
technology . The Decree also includes the possibility to introduce a cap above which 
additional megawatt- hours would not benefit from the premium and only get the 
market value. The monthly (or annual) market premium, depending on the technology, 
is calculated as the difference between the reference value of the technology and the 
average revenues of all installations of the same technology from the French energy and 
capacity markets, augmented by  a management premium covering the cost of direct 
access to these markets ( ex post ). As a result, this “sliding” premium allows producers to 
receive market signals and those producers proving able to better meet the market 
need s earn higher total revenues.  A simplified overview of the management of the new 
market premium is shown in Figure 9.6. 
Renewable heat  
Historically, France has placed strong emphasis on the heat sector, as a means to improve energy efficiency and foster energy security in the aftermaths of the oil crises of 
the 1970s. The share of total heat in final energy consumption wa s about 50% in 20 14, 
much more than electricity. The 2020 objectives of the French government  in the area of 
renewable heat are ambitious (33% of gross final consumption by 2020). However, the growth of biogas, solar thermal, geothermal, but also biomass , has been slower t han 
expected.

Several instruments are in place to support renewable heat. The 2012 T hermal 
Regulation (2012 TR) requires all new one -family homes to make use of some form of 
renewable energy (it is most often heat with bioenergy, solar water heating or heat 
pumps, but can also be electricity from photovoltaics).  
The income tax credit for sustainable development (CIDD), and as of 2015 the income 
tax credit for the energy transition (CITE), promote the purchase of equipment using  
renewable or recovered energy through a 30% rebate from capital cost and a 5.5% VAT 
rate (in both new and existing dwellings) . Since 2009, the zero -rate eco -loan (écopr êt à 
taux z éro) has supported thermal renovation in houses, including in some using 
renewable heat.  
The combination of the 2012 Thermal Regulations and tax incentives has supported the 
strong development of heat pumps. France is the largest heat pump market in Europe, 
followed by Italy and Poland (EPHA, 2016). In 2012, heat p umps accounted for 12% o f 
11.9 Mtoe  of renewable heat. 
The Fonds Chaleur (Heat Fund) allocates EUR 220 million per year to heat projects. The 
Fund is managed through ADEME with a national call for projects (Biomasse Chaleur 
Industrie Agriculture Tertiaire, BCIAT ) and regional grants and call for projects. Over the 
period 2009 -15, around 1.79 Mtoe  renewable heat production per year was supported 
at an average public cost of around EUR 40 per  toe over 20 years, with a total budget of 
EUR 1.5 billion  for the period. The government intends to double the Heat Fund i n 2017.  
The total annual cost of renewable heat incentives is estimated to amount to about 
EUR 500 million  (Heat F und, CITE, and VAT rate).

159 In 2015, the government introduced a clear improvement with the  single permit 
(bundling of procedure s and authorisations) in regions with significant wind power 
potential. It  suppressed the wind turbine development zones and supported the 
negotiations with the radar authorities  concerned. The Energy Transition for Green 
Growth Act shortened the time for appeals for all projects outside the single licence 
procedure. 
Furthermore, to remove the main barrier of public contestation and lack of social 
acceptance, the Energy Transition  for Green Growth Act has improved the procedure for 
the participation of local communities and land -owners for financing of renewable 
projects.  
ASSESSMENT  
France has witnessed a steady growth of the renewable share in gross final energy 
consumption. Howe ver, it is not on track to achiev e its target of 23% by 2020. With a 
share of 14.6% in 2014, the growth in the next six years (2015 -20) will need to be twice 
the rates achieved over the last nine  years (2005 -14). The National Action Plan of 2010 
to support  renewable energy generation set intermediate targets towards the 2020 
objectives.  These objectives were  revised in April 2016 to take into account the real 
development of each technology since 2010 and the barriers identified.  Targets have 
been reached fo r solar PV and biomass, which both account for more than 36% of the 
growth of the renewable energy share since 2005. B ut there is a gap to be filled for 
hydro, wind power and heat. Future growth is expected to come from wind power and 
solar PV , and also from  renewable heat, which all have seen a favourable growth in 
recent years.  
Hydropower, today the second -largest source of renewable electricity, cannot be 
expected to contribute more than the current level because of  physical limitation and 
environmental requirements. The legal framework of the Transition Act did not 
encourage the renewal of concessions through competitive tenders.  
Onshore wind has reached about 10 GW but offshore wind deployment has not 
started, despite ambitious plans of the French government. T he slow growth of 
renewable energy deployment, notably wind energy, is the result of non- economic 
barriers  more than economic ones, including the various administrative and judiciary 
procedures for having a permit cleared of any claim (7 years  on average for wind 
mills),  coupled with a lack of social acceptance for wind and biomass . The  single permit  
should improve permitting for onshore/offshore wind parks. The accumulation of 
regulations, successive changes, and the need to address additional  constraints 
imposed by urbanisation, safety or environmental considerations, result in lengthy procedures for the commissioning of installations and the connection works to the 
grid. The measures taken by the Transition Act addressed these issues and will  remove 
an important part of the barriers to renewables development. 
Development of renewable energy generation is fostered by support schemes established by the French authorities. Some are common for both electricity and heat 
generation, such as reduced VAT, tax credit, and co -funding of research and 
development (via grants, reimbursable subsidies, or venture capital). Building s 
regulations promote renewable heat or electricity generation. Others are specific to the field considered. To support ambitious goals for heat generation and biogas,

160 France set up the Heat Fund, endowed with a EUR  1.3 billion budget for 2009 -14. The 
future budget should reflect 2020 objectives; the government aims to double it by 
2017.  
In addition, the government  has adopted action plans for the deployment of some green 
energy technologies, including biogas production, solar PV, offshore wind (tenders and 
technology roadmap), ocean energy (National Committee for Ocean Energy and Marine Current Power), and biomass.  
For electricity generation, the purchase of the renewable output is guaranteed at fixed 
prices through feed -in tariffs for 10  to 20 years for wind onshore, small hydro, small  
biogas and solar (below 100  kWp), through a purchase obligation by the national 
operator EDF and local utilities, regardless of the supply -demand balance on the market. 
Open counter  tariffs were adjusted on  several occasions by decrees to better match 
decreasing levelised costs  of technologies over time . Bigger capacities (solar above 
100 kWp , wind of fshore  and bi omass) are delivered through tenders. The energy 
regulator advis es the government on the level of the feed- in tariff  and on reference 
values for the feed- in premium. 
Until 2015, the F IT budget was raised entirely through the CSPE ( contribution to 
electricity public services), collected by incumbent EDF from the final electricity 
consumers. The overall public expenditure in support of renewable energy generation has increased significantly since the last review  in 2009 , as illustrated  by the drastic rise 
in EDF’s  CSPE debt, as contributions remained rather flat. In 2015, the government acted 
on time to avoid the financial collapse of the system and reduce d the burden to final 
electricity consumers. The Energy Transition  for Green Growth Act set in motion several 
reforms to improve support mechanisms with a view to boost the share of renewable energies to 30% by 2030. In 2016, the government brought the CSPE under the s tate 
budget and p arliamentary control and , in 2017, it plans to merge  the renewable energy 
contribution with the current excise tax on electricity (t axe intérieure sur la 
consommation f inale d’ électricité, TICFE) and the new Energy and Climate Contribution 
(or carbon tax ), which will be EUR 30.5 per t onne of CO
2.This is a commendable progress 
that should allow to broaden the tax base, improve the financing and transparency of 
the support, its budgetary control by Parliament and  also strengthen the financial 
viability of the scheme.  
In 2016, the government presente d its reformed renewable support scheme, which will 
promote the integration of renewable energy in the power system, in line with  the EU 
guidelines of 2014, the CSPE reform and the requirements of the Transition Act . Feed- in 
premiums can ensure that electricity from renewable energy is integrated into the 
market by responding to market signals and dynamics. Technology reference values 
should better reflect benchmarked cost s and support the technology development 
towards the integration of intermittent renewable energy into the market and the grid.   
The rapid cost reduction of the less controversial photovoltaic technology offers an 
opportunity to tip the balance between technologies, which the government 
pragmatically exploits to compensate for the difficulties in deploying wind power. 
However, this could be insufficient to achieve the country’s European binding 
commitment to reach 23% of renewables in gross final energy consumption by 2020, and 
put it on a path to rebalancing nuclear power and renewable ele ctricity by 2025 , as the 
law requires, without increasing fossil fuel consumption and associated emissions. The new solar targets will require installing about 2  000 MW capacity per year. However, this

161 may not suffice, and neighbouring countries have proven able – at a time whe n costs 
were much higher – to install PV at a much more rapid pace.  Other renewable sources 
will thus play an important role in the achievement of the 2020 target.  
Additional energy system costs have to be considered with the expected  rise of energy 
generated from renewable sources. For historical reasons, the French grid was 
developed for centralised generation by nuclear plants generating baseload power. It 
will need to be adapted to decentralised production sources and designed to address the variability of renewable energy sources. However, baseload generation itself required 
flexibility to respond to the variations of demand, so that significant pumped- storage 
hydropower capacities were built alongside the nuclear power plants: they can also  
accommodate variable generation. For its part, the TSO indicates that up to 2030, there is no need for major transformation of the transmission  system to integrate growing 
shares of variable renewables. While the targets are set at national level, investment needs will have to be discussed and agreed at regional level between local authorities 
and the electricity TSO and DSOs.  
Towards 2020 and 2030, France has set ambitious targets, notably for renewable heat 
and biomass. The current combination of measures, ranging from the Heat Fund to tax 
incentives and building regulation , has stimulated a number of technologies and should 
be continued on the basis of a renewed National Renewable Energy Action P lan for 
2030 , including a dedicated heat strategy with targets and milestones for delivery.  
RECOMMENDATIONS  
The government of France should: 
 Implement the  reformed renewable electricity support scheme in  line with the 
pluriannual energy programm ing to ensure it reflects market signals and 
benchmarked technology costs, while addressing the need for transparency, long-
term predictability and certainty to gain  investors' confidence.  
 Continue to broaden the tax base  for the financing of renewable energy support with 
a view to  minimise the burden of the energy transition while sharing the cost across 
all energy consumer groups.  
 Continue to  simplify the administrative procedures and shorten the lead times for 
obtaining the necessary permits; prepare the siting of wind parks and their 
connection to and integration in the electricity network, without prejudice to 
environmental requirements in permits/authorisations.  
 Set out a clear strategy and a detailed implementation plan for achieving the 
ambitious renewable heat targets, notably through the pluriannual energy 
programming, with instruments and budgets to address a range of barriers and 
improve the valorisation of biomass.

Key data (2015 estimated)    
Number of reactors: 58 reactors operated by EDF , one under construction  
Installed capacity: 65.9/ 63.2 GW e (brutto /net to)    
Electricity generation: 4 33.66 TWh  nuclear  
Share of nuclear: 46.4% of TPES and  77.7% of electricity generation 
OVERVIEW 
In 2015, France ’s installed nuclear  power capacity was ne tto 63.2 GW e and consisted 
of 58 commercial reactors operated by É lectricité de France ( EDF). Nuclear accounted 
for 7 7.7% or 433.66  terawatt -hour (TWh ) of France ’s electricity generation in 201 5. 
Compared to other IEA member countries, France has the highest share of nuclear 
both in total primary energy supply (TPES ) and electricity generation . Since the last 
nuclear unit was connected to the grid at the end of the 1990s , the share of nuclear 
gener ation has been stable over time, contributing to the overall low carbon footprint 
of the French power sector, together with hydropower which accounted for 10% of 
the electricity generated in 2015.  
The nuclear power sector is enter ing a new  phase. The average age of the nuclear  fleet 
climbed to thirty  years  recently . As the original design lifetime  of the operating plants 
is forty  years, questions about the lifetime extension and/or r eplacement by new 
plants  are at the top of the nuclear agenda, at industry, safety authority and 
government levels. The underlying issues are multiple and interconnected, embracing 
technical and safety matters, economics, security and reliability of supply, environmental aspects, and politics. Important investmen t decisions need to be taken 
to cover the necessary upgrading programmes for long -term operation (LTO) and 
safety  requirements following the Fukushima Daiichi accident . The Nuclear Safety 
Authority (ASN) determined , after Fukushima,  that  the French reactor s were safe for 
continued  operation, but that their resistance to extreme situation s needed to  be 
improved. EDF has estimated the cost of the full lifetime extension programme, the 
so-called “ Grand Carénage”, to amount to EUR 47.5  billion for the period 2014- 25, 
including the post -Fukushima safety upgrades of around EUR 10  billion. Much larger 
investments would be necessary for the renewal of the fleet, because of  the 
substantial construction cost s. In addition, financial provisions need to be  accumulated  
over the design lifetime of the reactors to secure the funding of the legacy, 
decommissioning and waste management, including ge ological disposal. The  decisions 
on lifetime extension and LTO  will impact  those  cost and financial provisions .

164 substantial cost overruns of the European pressurised water reactor s (EPRs ) in 
Olkiluoto (in Finland) an d Flamanville, and with the investment decision made for 
Hinkley Point in the United  Kingdom.  
In the light of an ageing nuclear fleet, the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act ( Loi 
relative à la transition énergétique pour la croissance verte, LTECV) set a target of 
maximum  50% nuclear contribution to the electricity mix in 2025, with a cap at the 
current 63.2 GW e of netto installed capacity . The cap means that two operating units 
would be shut down when the EPR under construction in Flamanville come s on line, in 
accordance with the French President’s decision to close the two reactors of Fessenheim . 
The target results in several challenges for the French energy sector. The Energy 
Transition of Green Growth Act’s target of 50% and the ageing fleet will  have an 
influence on the security and reliability of supply, on the cost of electricity, on the 
nuclear industrial policy, and it could also impact environmental objectives if nuclear is, 
at least temporarily, replaced by gas -fired power plants.  
On the basis of specific assumptions of future electricity demand and exports, t he French 
Court of Auditors (CdC, 2015) estimated that the  50% nuclear electricity target in 2025  
would translate into  the shutdown of up to 20 units out of the 58 in operation today. A 
large number of the reactors reaching their design lifetime in the next 5 to 10 years 
would not undergo upgrading programmes and, instead, would be shut down when 
reaching 40 years of operation, even if such lifetime extension after upgrades would be 
authoris ed on safety grounds. From an economic point of view, investing in major 
lifetime extension programmes makes sense only if LTO is possible for an extended 
period of time after the refurbishment (10  to 20 years). Beyond the economic dimension 
of the decision, there are impacts on the security/reliability of supply and t he 
greenhouse gas emission  goals. Achieving a 50% share by 2025 through the addition of 
alternative low -carbon sources within less than ten years will have an impact on the 
security and r eliability of supply, the cost of electricity, and the French nuclear industry.  
In light of evolving electricity markets, actual uncertainties will need to be addressed in the future  pluriannual energy programming (PPE)  of the government.  
INSTITUTIONAL FRA MEWORK  
ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES  
Different m inistries have responsibilities for nuclear issues in France. The Ministry of 
Environment, Energy and the Sea (MEEM)  has the main responsibility. The Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs  and the Secretariat General for European Affairs  are responsible for 
official international affairs aspects. The Ministry for Research and the Ministry for 
Defence  have their specific responsibilities.  
In 2008, the Conseil de politique n ucléaire (CPN)  was established, chaired by the 
President of France, reflecting the continued strategic importance of nuclear energy for 
France and ensuring an overall co -ordination role.   
SAFETY AUTHORITY  
The Nuclear Safety Authority (Autorité de sûreté nucléaire , ASN ) was established as an 
independent administrative a uthority by the so called TSN Law (Loi relative à la 
transparence et à la sécurité en matière nucléaire ) of June 2006. This law ensures the full

165 independence of ASN from the ministries, foster s transparency by installing a High 
Committee for the purpose and gives a legal framework to the Local Information 
Committees ( Comm issions locales d’ information,  CLI). The ASN is responsible to 
control all civil nuclear activities in France and contributes to the information of the 
public. In particular the ASN is charged to provide the construction and operation 
licen ces for nuclear power plants (NPPs) and installations of the fuel cycle. It is 
mandated to perform inspections and is allowed to take necessary measure s (up to 
the shutdown of a plant), at any time, in case a safety problem appears.  
In France as in most other European countries, licen ces are not provided for the full 
duration of the plant lifetime. E very  ten years, the plant owner is required to submit a 
safety file on which the ASN will make its evaluation and give the authorisation for continued operation for the next decade.  
PUBLIC AGENCIES AND ORGANISATIONS  
The Commissariat à l’ Énergie Atomique et aux É nergies Alternatives  (CEA)  is the main 
public nuclear research organisation in France. It also has responsibilities for representing France in international relations, in particular at the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA).  
The Institut de Radiopr otection et de Sûreté Nucléaire  (IRSN) was created in 2001 to 
be the public technical expert body for radiation protection and nuclear safety. It serves as the Technical Safety Organisation (TSO) in support to ASN, and provides 
much technical support internationally.  
The Agence nationale pour la gestion de s déchets (ANDRA)  was created in 1991, but 
saw its mandate reinforced by the Law of 2006 on the management of nuclear waste. It is a public body with an industrial responsibility, under the MEEM, in charge of the 
long -term manage ment of all nuclear waste produced in France.  
INDUSTRIAL ACTORS  
The French s tate holds majority stakes in the country’s nuclear and electricity industry. 
EDF is the largest electricity producer in France (also the  main player worldwide with a 
total of 135 GW e installed capacity), with a 85.3% public stake . All NPPs  in France are 
operated by EDF wh ich is also its own  architect -engineer and has developed a strong 
expertise in building nuclear power stations. (Second in France in terms of electricity generation, E NGIE operates the seven  nuclear plants in Belgium.)  
Majority state -owned AREVA is the designer/supplier of the French pressurised water 
reactor (PWR ) nuclear plants (at the origin under a licenc e from Westing house) and 
the main industrial actor in the nucl ear fuel cycle, from mining of uranium, conversion 
and enrichment, to reprocessing. Until recently, the first activity was handled by AREVA NP (formerly Framatome), and the second by AREVA NC (formerly Cogema). 
The state holds majority shares in AREVA through the French Alternative Energ ies and 
Atomic Energy Commission (54.37%), the Banque publique d'investissement  (3.32%), 
and the Agence des participations de l'État  (28.83%).  
AREVA is effecting a strategic refocusing on its nuclear fuel cycle business, with 
projects to withdraw from cert ain activities and divest assets outside the scope of the

166 fuel cycle, in particular activities linked to renewables, propulsion and research 
reactors (its third branch AREVA TA, formerly Technicatome). These remain, until such time as divestments occur, within the scope of AREVA SA.  
AREVA  is reorganising into two main  activities,  with  New AREVA  (NA) and AREVA  NP 
(nuclear plants). New AREVA includes all of the fuel cycle activities and related central 
departments. New AREVA, refocused on the production and recycling of nuclear 
materials and waste management, will develop its activities in mining, uranium 
chemistry (conversion and enrichment), used fuel recycling, logistics, dismantling and 
fuel cycle engineering.  The alignment of interests within the nuclear sector in France 
decided by the government also involves the takeover of AREVA NP by EDF. AREVA NP 
covers the Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS – primary side of NPPs ) design, supply, 
construction, maintenance and modernis ation activities, as well as fuel design and 
fabrication. 
An agreement in principle has been concluded with EDF on the sale price of AREVA NP at 
EUR 2.5 billion , pending the approval of the French competition authority  and under the 
EU merger control rules . The French s tate made  the commitment to support the  
recapitalis ation  of AREVA SA (EUR  4.5 billion ) and EDF (EUR 3 b illion). The European 
Commission approved on 10  January 2017  French state's contribution to the financing of 
the A REVA  group's restructuring under EU rules on state aid.  The Commission concluded 
that the  restructuring plan of AREVA and its future focus on the nuclear fuel cycle can 
restore the undertaking's long -term viability and allow A REVA  to operate without 
constant injections of public funds. The Commission requires that the sale  makes a 
sufficient, real contribution to the costs of its restructuring  and approved a bridging loan 
by the government of EUR 3.3 billion  until the sale is completed. The approval of the 
state aid is subject to the effective divestment of the nuclear business and the p ositive 
result of tests, performed at the request of the ASN , on the Flamanville III nuclear 
reactor vessel, which is supplied by Areva . 
HISTORICAL BACKGROUN D 
Out of a total of 129 GW e netto generating installed capa city in 2015, nearly half 
(63.2 GW e) was  nuclear, producing 77.7% of the consumed electricity. This share  of 
nuclear- generated electricity has been  rather stable since 1985, when most of the 34 
units of 900  megawatts -electric (MW e) units were in operation (see Figure 10.1). This is 
to be  compared with the maximum historic peak demand of around 100 GW e capacity.  
Frances’s unique position with regard to nuclear electricity is the result of the French government decision in 1974 to opt for nuclear energy as the main element of security 
of supply, nuclear fuel being considered as quasi domestic because of  the diversity of 
supply sources and the ability to store years of nuclear fuel  reserves.  
Within the following ten years, most of the 34 units of “900 MW
e” were commissione d, 
followed by 20 units of “1  300 MW e” in the following decade. The last four  units of 
“1 450 MW e” came  all on line at  the turn of the millennium (Figure 10.2). This was only 
possible due to a strongly developed and well organised industrial sector (integrating the 
supplier of technology, the supply chain, the owner- operator also acting as architect-
engineer, the fuel cycle industry, an efficient nuclear licensing process, combined with 
very active research programmes).

Harmonisation and standardisation allowed economies of scale at the time of both 
design and construction, as well as for operation and maintenance, while at the same 
time introducing  a risk of common mode problem or failure, which could require the 
simultaneous shutdown of a number of plants if a failure were to be detected.   
The nuclear sector in France allowed the country to be a net exporter of electricity for 
many  years, with a net export of 75.1 TWh in 2015, contributing to the overall stability 
and reliability of supply in the wider region. The French nuclear sector has been a key player on the worldwide nuclear technology export market, both in the reactors and fuel 
cycle activities.  
In 2005, a law established guidelines for energy policy and security, where the role of 
nuclear energy was central, leading to the decision to build a first Gen III EPR (resulting 
from the mix of French  and German technologies) as a FOAK (f irst-of-a-kind), opening 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%

168 the path for further commercial deployment as of 2015, both for the domestic and 
export markets.  
In 2008, the Conseil de politique nucléaire (CPN) was established, chaired by the 
President, reflecting the continued strategic importance of nuclear energy  and 
international development . CPN tasked the CEA to develop a comprehensive partnership 
with the Chinese authorities on all aspects of the civil nuclear power sector, including safety. The  Agence France Nucléaire International (AFNI) was created in 2008 under CEA 
to provide a vehicle for international cooperation and  assistance.  
Following the wide “national debate on the energy transition” launched in 2012, the Office Parlementaire d’ Évaluation des Choix Scientifiques et Technologiques  (OPECST ) 
issued a report in September 2013 recognising the risk in terms of security of supply and 
power prices shocks of pursuing a speedy reduction of the nuclear contribution to the 
electricity supply with insufficient replacement by energy efficiency and other low 
carbon sources.  
The Energy Transition for Green Growth Act (Loi relative à la transition énergétique pour 
la croissance verte , LTECV) was passed at the Na tional Assembly in 2015 , setting a limit 
of 50% for the nuclear contribution to electricity generation in 2025 and a cap of 
63.2  GW
e nuclear installed capacity from now on and over time (corresponding to the 
installed capacity in 2014 with the 58 units in operation, which means that two 
operating units would be shut down, at the latest when the EPR under construction in Flamanville comes on line – expected end of 2018, in line with the decision of the French 
president to close the two reactors of Fessenheim ). The  Act also set  a target of 32% of 
renewables in the energy mix in 2030, which can be translated into 40% in the power 
sector.  
And, last but not least, the French power sector has been for a long time and still is 
extremely low -carbon with  contribution of the high share of nuclear (combined with 
hydropower) in the mix (see Figure 10.3).

169 ECON OMIC ASPECTS OF NUCL EAR ELEC TRICIT Y IN FRANCE   
LONG- TERM OPERATION ( GRAND CAR ÉNAGE ) 
To fulfil the  objectives of the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act , it is estimated that 
17 to  20 nuclear units of 900 MW e would no longer be required by 2025 and are likely to 
be closed, as confirmed by the 2016 report of the Cour des Comptes, assuming a flat 
evolution of the demand and exports of electricity. Beyond the pure “electricity supply” 
issue associated with this decision, there is another central question related to the 
global industrial and economic aspects, in particular for EDF and the nuclear industry, 
but also for the final electricity consumer. Future electricity supply/demand scenarios 
involve uncertainty and should be assessed and updated to determine the future outlook for the nuclear fleet. The government will assess these fundamentals of the 
outlook in the  pluriannual energy programming (PPE).  
Out of the 34 units of 900 MW
e, 32 will reach their design lifetime (40 years of 
operation) between 2017 and 2025 (see Figure 10 .2). EDF has made an evaluation of the 
cost of refurbishment necessary to allow lifetime extension (also ca lled long -term 
operation) beyond these 40 years. This refurbishment has been called the “ Grand 
Carénage ”. In France, the authorisation for operation, delivered strictly on safety 
grounds by the Nuclear Safety Authority, is given for periods of 10 years after the so -
called “ révision déce nnale ”. The cost estimated by EDF to go for long -term operation for 
at least ten more years, from 40 to 50 years, but with the prospect of an extension for 
the next ten -year period also, up to 60 years, is EUR 47.5  billion, t o be  spent over the 
period 2014 -25. This includes the costs of both refurbishment and the safety upgrades to 
keep the safety levels at the highest standards, in particular by implementing the post -
Fukushima safety measures. In 2016, the report of the Cour des Comptes  estimated the 
cost for long- term operation at EUR 100 b illion (CdC, 2016) , but for the period 2014 -30, 
and including EUR 25  billion for regular maintenance costs, not included in the EDF 
figures of EUR 47.5 billion which run to 2025. All these cost estimates are above  LTO 
investment made in other IEA jurisdictions (i.e.  the United States, Belgium).  
The strict application of the objective of “50% nuclear in 2025” of the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act  would make this lifetime extension , refurbishment and safety 
upgrade programmes not economically viable for 17 to 20 plants. T his would be a 
definitive decision since the upgrades would have to be implemented before reaching the 40 years to obtain  the authorisation to go beyond.  
Existing n uclear plants are producing affordable  electricity, even considering the 
refurbishment costs for long -term operation. Refurbishment for LTO needs to be 
evaluated against the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of other low -carbon sources for 
a lifetime of  20 years.  A refurbishment cost of up to EUR 1 b illion per unit (or 
EUR 35/MWh levelised cost of electricity
1 for an additional 20  years compares to the cost 
of a nuclear new Gen eration  III build  (EUR 115/MWh levelised cost of electricity)  
(IEA/NEA, 2015 ). However, over the past few years, the cost of renewable energy 
technologies has also come  down quickly and is expected to continue to decrease 
further.

estimates), at a  discount rate of 10% (highest value), O&M (operation and mainte nance) and fuel cycle cost (including waste 
management and decommissioning provision) of EUR 4/MWh.

170 NEW BUILDS  
Two European Pressurised Water Reactors (EPRs ) are under construction in Europe : in 
Finland  (Olkiluoto 3) and in France (Flamanville 3). Two others are being built in China. 
The design is the result of the combination of the French Framatome and German KWU 
Siemens expertise. The origin of the common design was the wish, in the 1990s, to have 
one common and harmonised design for the European market. The final product of 
AREVA complies with the highest safety levels and , in particular, the principle of no 
radioactive releases beyond the fence of the site in case of core meltdown.  
Contrary to construction on schedule in China, important delays and large cost overruns 
are impacting both EPRs construction in Finland and France.  It is one of the reasons of 
the serious financial difficulties encountered by AREVA in the recent years, which have resulted in the decision to have EDF taking over the “reactor business” of AREVA, leaving 
it with the fuel cycle business. The details of this process and the respective cross -share 
are expected to be in place for the end of 2016. EDF will therefore become the French 
reactor technology leader, including for the export market. Beyond the interests of both 
industrial groups, this move has strong political support, showing the importance the 
country puts on its nuclear energy and industrial policy. Th e liabilities of the Olkiluoto 
EPR project will nevertheless stay with AREVA as a turnkey project.  
After Flamanville, the first EPR plant to be built under  the EDF flag should be the 
Hinckley Point C unit in the U nited Kingdom , to be owned by EDF Energy  together with a 
Chinese stakeholder. EDF took  the final investment decision (FID) in August 2016, which 
will rely on diverse domestic and foreign sources, in a difficult financial environment for the company. The EDF investment decision taken in the fall of  2016 for Hinckley P oint 
relied on the previous UK g overnment offer for a Contract for Difference mechanism, 
with a strike price at GBP  92 per MWh. This mechanism, applicable to nuclear as well as 
to wind power (but with a higher strike price), as part of the UK low -carbon energy 
policy, has been reviewed and accepted by the European Commission as not contradicting European State Aid rules.  
The UK government has reviewed the project in 2016, without changing the conditions 
of the investment, and decided to strengthen the provisions for the state to have a 
golden share with a view to foster national security.   
With  experience gained from  the EPRs in Finland, France and China, EDF and AREVA are 
revisiting the EPR design, making it simpler and more cost effective, cheaper and easier 
to build and operate/maintain, while keeping the highest levels of safety. This new 
design is called EPR NM (EPR New Model).  In March 2016, AREVA, EDF and the CEA 
announced the creation of the Plateforme France Nucléaire  (PFN ) to devise a shared 
medium- and long -term vision for the French nuclear industry, providing consolidated 
inputs to the CPN. Its initial agenda will focus on a review of technological options for the EPR design and associated regulatory aspects, on the future of reprocessing, on deep 
geological repository (CIGEO), on decommissioning technologies, and on research and 
development for Gen eration IV reactors.  When it comes to the French export policy on 
nuclear reactor technology beyond the EPR, mainly towards countries embarking upon nuclear programmes, the CPN called on AREVA, EDF and GDF  SUEZ (now E NGIE) in 2011 
to strengthen collaboration on the Atmea 1 100 MW
e, a Gen eration III design developed 
under a 2006 joint venture between AREVA and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). Similarly, work has also started to look into the technical, legal and economic aspects of small reactor designs (100 to 300 MW
e).

171 FINANCING CHALLENGES  
The construction (overnight) cost of the nuclear power programme in France was 
estimated at FF 400 b illion in 1993 currency. Half has been self -financed by EDF, 42% by 
commercial loans and 8% was invested by the s tate. In early 2009, EDF estimated that its 
operating reactors were providing electricity at a cost of EUR 46 /MWh. The NOME Law  
of 201 0  (for the new organisation of the electricity market)  introduced the ARENH floor 
price at EUR 40/MWh in 2011 to provide a stable remuneration in return for  access to 
EDF’s nuclear- generated electricity for other market participants as an element to fost er 
market competition. The ARENH price calculation integrated the anticipated investment 
costs for the refurbishment  of the existing fleet  for long- term operation.  The ARENH 
price was in line with the Cour des Comptes  (CdC, 2012) estimated range of EUR 33 to 50 
(2010 value) per MWh, depending on the calculation method, noting that the costs 
could be increased by EUR 3/MWh for higher back -end costs. In a revised report in 2014, 
the CdC considered that the cost of nuclear generation had increased by 20% be tween 
2010 and 2013 to EUR  62 (2012 value) /MWh, half of it reflecting increased maintenance 
costs and their accounting allocation. EDF estimated EUR 56  (2012 value) /MWh, 
assuming a 50 -year operation and integrating the cost of the G rand Carénage . The 
ARENH price was revised to EUR 42/MWh in 2012.  
In 2016, wholesale prices of electricity in Europe are very low, and well below what is 
considered necessary to recoup the large front -loaded investment cost of capital-
intensive low -carbon electricity generation facilities, be it nuclear or variable renewable. 
This contributes to the difficult financial environment for EDF when the time of refurbishment and new bui ld is coming.   The 2016 average wholesale price of electricity 
is well below the ARENH price, rendering this floor price, designed to facilitate new entrants on the electricity market, unnecessary at the present time.  The future of 
ARENH should be evaluated.  
The overnight capital cost of construction of the EPR in Flamanville was initially estimated at E UR 3.3 billion, corresponding to a cost of electricity at EUR 46/MWh (a 
figure familiar in literature for a discount rate at 5%). Mass production was expected to 
reduce the costs by 20%. The construction on site started in 2007 with commercial operation expected in 2012. A number of problems have led to delays and overruns. In 
its report of 2012, the Cour des Comptes estimated the cost of electricity by EPR 
between EUR 70 and 90  (2010  value) /MWh, on the bas is of an overnight capital cost of 
EUR 6 b illion at  that time. In September 2015, with 98% of the civil works completed and 
60% of the mechanical equipment installed, the cost escalation had reached 
EUR 10.5  billion and the expected operation date was  moved to the end of 2018. The 
overnight capital cost in the order of EUR 6 500/kW
e installed for this first -of-a- kind  
plant, combined with increased financing costs due to the delays in construction, explains why EDF is now working on the EPR NM (New M odel) with simplified 
construction and significant cost reduction, to become the flagship for the future French new builds and the export market.  
The economics of nuclear power is affected by the load factor. Because of the high fraction of nuclear- generated electricity, some of the French plants are operated in load -
follow mode. The capacity factor may therefore appear somewhat low in France 
compared to a number of other countries.  The 2016 report of the CdC indicates that a 
further reduction of the load factor to 50% would lead to an electricity generation co st 
increase to EUR 125/MWh  (CdC, 2016) .

172 It shows that, in case of the  strict application of the Energy Transition for Green Growth 
Act’s  “50% nuclear target in 2025”, the option to drastically reduce the load factor in a 
large number of plants, instead  of closing a number of them, would worsen the 
economics. 
NUCLEAR SAFETY  
INSTITUTIONAL  FRAMEWORK 
Since the 2006 institutional reform, a comprehensive regulatory framework has been  
established, based on a 2012 ministerial  order and 15 ASN technical regulato ry 
resolutions in line with the WENRA (Western European Nuclear Regulatory Authorities) reference levels.  
The Energy Transition  for Green Growth Act reinforces the regulatory framework by 
widening the ASN enforcement powers (pecuniary sanctions, control over suppliers and subcontractors), by affirmation of the need for immediate dismantling instead of long-
term safe storage after plant definitive shutdown, and by enhancing information and 
transparency. 
Operating licen ces do not have time limitations, but periodic safety reviews have to take 
place every ten  years (ré vision déce nnale ), to check the conditions and conformity of 
the plants, and allow safety upgrading  in light of operating experience, scientific 
developments and recent best practices.   
FUKUSH IMA DAIICHI 
Following the Fukushima Daiichi accident in March 2011, so -called “ stress tests” have 
been applied to all operating nuclear power reactors in the European Union. This was 
organised by the European Commission and implemented with the National Sa fety 
Authorities and their technical s afety organisations. The French Safety Authority (ASN) 
and its Technical Safety Institute (Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire, 
IRSN) have been central in this process which showed that, while safety imp rovements 
were necessary to increase the resistance towards extreme external events, none of the 
plants operated in the EU (and so the 58  French nuclear units) had to be shut down for 
safety reasons. In some countries and in France in particular, other nuclear facilities (fuel 
cycle facilities and research reactors) were also submitted to the stress tests, including the EPR under construction.  
According to the  report of the IRSN, which was released in conjunction with the ASN, a 
set of “hard core” safety measures for the  protection of vital safety structures, systems 
and components are necessary to maintain critical safety functions in case of beyond -
design -basis events, such as major earthquakes, extended fires or prolonged loss of 
power supply or emergency  core cooling. A local emergency management centre also 
needs to be operational at each site. All the measures are under implementation at all 
plants, mainly programmed during outage periods. One specific issue was related to the resistance of the basemat of the Fessenheim reactors. The remedial works were 
completed in 2013, allowing the continuation of the operation until the 40 years are 
reached in 2017. Besides the onsite  upgradings, EDF has also created the Nuclear Rapid 
Response Force (FARN). The aim is to be able to quickly deploy qualified staff and

173 equipment to any reactor site in case of an accident, to complement, if needed , what 
can be done on the site itself, in particular in terms of cooling and electricity supply.   
PERIODIC SAFETY REVIEW AND LIFETIME EXTENSION  
The French nuclear safety authority ASN carries out periodic safety reviews for the 
different fleet parts (so -called palier ). ASN gave a generic position on the EDF ’s Grand 
Carénage programme (up to 60 years) in 2013. Orientations were provided for the 
fourth periodic safety review in 2015 and conclusions on generic studies and plant modifications (for the whole 900 MW
e fleet) are expected in 2018. From 2019 onwards, 
each 900 MW e reactor will undergo modifications and controls. About one year after, 
ASN is expected to take a position on the extended operation for another 10 years, 
including a public consultation.  
For long- term operation of the existing units, beyond the 40 years design lifetime, 
(Grand Carénage programme), EDF is responsible for preparing  the safety files for each 
reactor and submit them to ASN. ASN will evaluate them, using to the maximum extent 
possible Generation  III criteria for the safety level , and will also analyse the ag eing and 
obsolescence for more than the next 10 years, anticipating a possible further lifetime extension up to 60 years. If safety levels are satisfactory, the authorisation for further 
operation will then be given for an extra ten years for each reactor, based on the 
principle of the “ révision déce nnale ”. Timewise one can expect the decision -making 
process to fit with the timeline of reaching the 40 years operation of the plants.  
In 2015, tests on the material of the EPR under construction in Flamanville, requested by the ASN, showed a high carbon content and a one -third lower than specified toughness. 
The safety- related assessments are ongoing, with result expected for end 2016. These 
tests triggered a general audit of the fabrication files of main nuclear components (reactor vessels, steam generators, primary piping , etc.) produced since 1965 at the 
Creusot plant, now part of A REVA . In a total of 10  000 analysed files, some anomalies, of 
diverse nature, were detected, related to components in operating EDF plants, but also to some components for ex port. Further Investigations are ongoing to evaluate the 
possible safety impact of each individual anomaly and take the appropriate action.   
FUEL CYCLE ACTIVITIE S 
On the fro nt end side, the new uranium- enrichment plant Georges Besse II, using 
centrifugation and replacing the closed Eurodif diffusion plant at Tricastin, started 
commercial operation in April 2011. The EUR 3 b illion two -unit plant with a nominal 
capacity of 7.5 million SWU ( separation w ork unit) was built and is operated by an 
AREVA subsidiary, with some minor shares proposed to customers. The south plant 
reached full capacity in 2015 and the north plant is expected to be a t full capacity  by end 
of 2016. EDF, as principal customer, signed a EUR 5 billion long -term delivery contract in 
2009, running for 17 years till 2025, corresponding to the amortis ation period of the 
plant. Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power signed a EUR 1 b illion long -term contract in 2007. 
The plant, with a third unit to be built, has a potential increase to 11 million SWU, which was the capacity of the old plant, delivering enrichment needs for a nuclear “fleet” of 
80 GW
e.  
AREVA decided in 2007 to replace its uranium conversion production capabilities by 
investing in a new conversion plant at the Malvési and Tricastin sites in France; known as

174 the Comurhex  II project. The new plant will have a full production capacity of 
15 000 metric tonne s, with the possibility of increasing capacity later to 21  000 tonnes, if 
market conditions permit. At this point, Comurhex  II is the only new conversion plant 
project to be launched in the world and it meets the most recent safety standard s, 
particularly in terms of its ability to withstand earthquakes and flooding. The 
Comurhex II plant is designed to offer maximum security of supply for the French nuclear 
fleet. In 2015, the nuclear safety authority ASN approved AREVA’s request to extend the 
operation of the Comurhex I production plant until the end of 2017. This will reduce the 
duration of the non -production phase, with integrated start -up of Comurhex II at both 
Malvesi and Tricastin sites planned for the end of 2018.  
On the back -end side, EDF sends yearly 1 050 ton nes of spent fuel to the AREVA La 
Hague reprocessing plant (out of 1  200 ton nes used fuel discharged each year, the 
diference is kept for later reprocessing to feed fast neutron reactors in the future); 97% 
of the reprocessed material is recycled (1  000 tonnes of u ranium and 10  tonnes of 
plutonium, allowing savings in terms of fresh uranium needed ) and 3% constitute the 
ultimate vitrified waste. The p lutonium is shipped to the Melox M OX fabrication plant  – 
producing 120 tonne s of M OX fuel used in 24 units of 900  MW e. The licensed capacity of 
Melox is 195 ton nes/year, providing spare capacity for foreign contracts. The strict 
application of the Energy Transition  for Green Growth Act, leading to the shutdow n of 
up to 20 of the 900  MW e reactors by 2025, would seriously impact the balance and the 
economics of the French  fuel cycle.  
NUCLEAR WASTE MANAGEMENT AND DECOMMISSIO NING  
Waste disposal in France is pursued under the 1991 Waste Management Act, updated in 
2006 after 15 years of intense research. ANDRA is responsible for the research and 
implementation of solutions for the long -term surface storage of conditioned waste, and 
for the final disposal of low -, intermediate- and high -level waste. ANDRA publishes a 
national waste inventory every t hree years.  
The 2006 Nuclear Materials and Waste Management Programme Act declared deep geological disposal as the reference solution for high- level and long lived -waste, and set 
2015 as the date for licensing a repository site and 2025 for its  opening. It also confirmed 
reprocessing and recycling as a way to reduce the quantity and toxicity of final waste, and called on the construction of a prototype Gen eration  IV fast-neutron reactor to test the 
transmutation potential of long- lived actinides (contained in spent fuel). A national waste 
management plan defining the goals and needed research is revised each three years.  
A report produced under the 2006 Act identifie s Bure as the best site for investigation of 
deep geological disposal in clay. A 2010 report evaluated that the transmutation of minor 
actinides in fast reactors would add 10% to the cost of power (and 20% if accelerator -
driven systems are used instead as dedicated actinide burners). It also noted that the 
“spent fuel” from transmutation reactors would be in interim storage for 70  years. A 2012 
report noted the great value of fast reactors for using p lutonium and their potential for 
transmuting long -lived m inor actinides, and flagged the need for an experimental reactor 
and the associated fuel cycle to test the industrial and economic viability of that concept, 
while maintaining France’s technology leadership.  
Drawing on the lessons of the Underground Research Laboratory in Bure, ANDRA is 
designing the 500 m eter- deep repository, called CIGEO (Centre industriel de s tockage

10. Nuclear Energy  
 
 
175 géologique ). In 2017, ANDRA is expected to submit its master plan for the commissioning 
and operation of CIGEO, to be immediately followed by the licen ce application. 
Construction would start in 2020 and the pilot operation in 2025. This would then be the 
third of such geological disposal facilities to enter operation, after the ones in Finland and 
Sweden, but the first one to host vitrified wast e resulting from reprocessing. In July 2016, 
The French Parliament confirmed the need of  reversibility criteria for the  CIGEO.  
Thirteen experimental and power reactors are under decommissioning in France. Nine are first-generation gas -cooled, graphite -moderated reactors. The four others are the two fast -
neutron reactors Ph énix and Super Ph énix, the experimental reactor at Brennilis and the 
PWR prototype at Chooz. The dismantling licenc e for Brennilis and Chooz were issued in 
2006 and 2007 respectively and works are proceeding.  
In 2008, ASN issued a policy recommendation for “immediate dismantling strategies” 
versus “safe storage for later dismantling”. EDF is working along this line, but in June 2016 
EDF announced that the effective decommissioning proc ess of the domestic first 
generation graphite- moderated reactors (curr ently all closed down) could be delayed 
pending solutions for the handling of sites for the disposal of alpha -contaminated graphite.  
Other nuclear facilities are also to be decommissioned. As examples one can cite the 
Eurodif enrichment plant closed in 2012, and the uranium -reprocessing plant  UP1 at 
Marcoule closed in 1997. AREVA is in charge for the first one and CEA for the second one, 
after some transfers of liabilities from EDF and AREVA.  
An important issue for the acceptability of nuclear energy is the assurance that the legacy, decommissioni ng and long -term waste management will be properly handled , and that the 
financing will be ensured and funds available when needed.  
The first thing to do to determine the needed provisions is to estimate the costs of decommissioning and long- term waste ma nagement, which is not easy because  the return 
of experience is limited (e.g. decommissioning) or not existing at all (e.g. deep geological 
disposal). In addition, the costs occur in a distant future, and evaluating the corresponding yearly provisions is much dependent on the discount rate. This said, whatever the 
uncertainties, the yearly feeding of the provisions converts into a rather small fraction of 
the cost of the electricity generated , or wholesale price sold, and even a drastic increase, 
while not  to be neglected, would not, on its own, seriously affect the competitiveness of 
nuclear energy.  
At the end of 2014, the total charge for decommissioning and waste management was  
EUR 99 b illion for all nuclear facilities: EDF power plants, but also CEA and AREVA 
installations. It can be further subdivided roughly into 45% for decommissioning, 20% for 
spent nuclear fuel management, 5% for legacy waste management and 30% for long -term 
waste management, including CIGEO.  
For the same year 2014, the necessary provisions  − taking into consideration the remaining 
years of operation of the plants until the design lifetime is reached  − amounted to 
EUR 52.5 b illion taking into consideration 53% for decommissioning, 21% for spent fuel 
management, 7% for legacy waste management and 20% for long -term waste 
management. These EUR  52.5 billion provisions are for 65% related to EDF, 22% to CEA 
and 12% to AREVA.  
Uncertainties are limited for spent fuel management thanks  to the extensive experience 
in that field. They are higher for decommissioning costs where experience is more limited , and even higher for long -term waste management. In particular, the estimation

10. Nuclear Energy  
 
  
176 for the CIGEO varied from simple to double between EDF and ANDRA calculations. In 
2016, the Ministry of Energy set the reference cost of CIGEO at EUR  25 billion (2011  
values), a figure to be updated once the construction project start s. More than half is for 
the construction and one- quarter for operation over 100 years. This figure is higher than 
the EDF estimation and will require an increase of the provisions of EUR 800 million  for 
EDF and EUR  250 million  for AREVA. The last year decreases of the discount rates also 
impact the calculations of the necessary provisions for given charg es.  
The required EUR 52.5  billion of financial provisions for the end of 2014 were covered by 
EUR 41.2  billion of dedicated assets. Other  provisions are not to be  covered by dedicated 
assets because they represent costs that are due and paid during the op eration of 
nuclear facilities (that is mainly the case of spent fuel treatment at La Hague, which is 
directly financed by power generation from NPP s. The Cour des Comptes reports (CdC,  
2012 and 2014) reviewed the situation and made  various recommendations to improve 
the framework, especially with regard to its governance or the evolution of the discount 
ceiling rate.  Liquidity of some assets is impaired by the acceptance of securities issued by 
operators’ subsidiaries and by inter -operators receivables. In the last few years  the 
MEEM has been reinforcing the  audit mechanism s so as to make them  similar to the 
tools used in the insurance sector, and to increase the strength of the financing of the 
nuclear long -term legacy.  
NUCLEAR FISSION RESE ARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  
For a number of years, public financing of nuclear research  has been in  the order of 
EUR 500 million per year, 90% of it for nuclear fission, the rest for fusion, not includ ing 
the special contribution to  the ITER project.  
Nearly 80% goes to the CEA, covering 60% of their nuclear research activities, the other 40% coming from external contracts, in particular from industry. The Programme for 
Investment in the Future  (Programme d’investissement s d’avenir, PIA ) for the period 
2010 -17, reserved EUR 1  billion for specific nuclear fission projects, in particular in 
support of the Jules Horowitz Research Reactor under construction and the planned ASTRID Demonstration Fast Neutron Reactor. Besides nuclear fission, France is also a key 
partner in nuclear fusion research, in particular hosting the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER ) project in Cadarache.  
The CEA is pursuing the construction of the Jules Horowitz reactor (JHR) in Cadarache , a 
100 megawatts thermal ( MW
th) material testing reactor. This is the first such reactor 
built for several decades . It will  replace a number of older research reactors which have 
been shut down or will soon be. The reactor will serve multiple goals, one being to 
support the long -term operation of the French nuclear power reactors. The overall cost 
of JHR was estimated at EUR 500 million (2005), of which EUR 200 million from the PIA. 
While works on site are progressing effectively, the start -up date has slipped in time and 
is now scheduled for 2020.  Post -Fukushima safety requirements have also been applied 
to JHR. All these, and other external factors, have led to a  threefold increase of the costs 
in 2015 e uros. 
In September 2010, the government confirmed  its support and funding of 
EUR 650 million fr om the PIA for the 600 MW e sodium -cooled ASTRID fast -neutron 
reactor (advanced sodium technological reactor for industrial d emonstration), led by 
CEA, with involvement of EDF and AREVA. In December 2012, the project moved

177 towards the design phase. W ork progresses on the associated fuel cycle research and 
facilities: a dedicated M OX fuel fabrication line and a pilot reprocessing plant. The  target 
date for the commissioning of ASTRID is 2023.  
CEA is leading the French activities and contributions in the Generation IV International 
Forum GIF. With the perspective of having Generation IV reactors commercially 
deployable as of 2040, CEA is investigating several fuel cycle strategies.  
One will also note the successful greenfield decommissioning by the CEA of the Siloé 
research reactor in Grenoble within the foreseen budget and timing. It could serve as a 
reference for other cases.    
ASSESSMENT  
Nuclear power accounted for 4 6% of TPES and 78% of electricity generation in 2015. 
France’s total installed capacity is 63.2 GW e with 58 Generation II operating nuclear power 
units at 19 sites, all from the same technology and supplier, and all operated by E DF. 
Seventy per cent of the nuclear fleet started  operation between 1977 and 1987. The fleet 
has an average age just over 30 years. An important issue in France therefore evolves 
around the economics of long- term operation (LTO, also called lifetime extension) of 
existing plants and  the timely decision on  the necessary upgrading and refurbishment 
programme, including for keeping up with the highest safety levels.  
The Energy Transition  for Green Growth  Act caps the nuclear capacity at the present level 
(63.2  GW) and targets the reduction of the share of nuclear -produced ele ctricity to 50% by 
2025, which c ould lead to the closure of 17 to 20 reactors if the ti meline is applied strictly 
and if these reactors cannot be used for electricity exports. The Act also calls for an 
increase of renewable- generated electricity from the 27% target in 2020 to 40% in 2030.  
The implementation of the 50% target remains challenging given the large role nuclear 
electricity has in the French mix (78%)  and the plants’  average age of 30 years . Depending 
on the evolution of electricity demand and progress in the deployment of renewable  
sources, which also entail considerable uncertainty even if France has a certain 
overcapacity, the 50% target may have impacts on the economics of electricity and final 
electricity prices, greenhouse gas emissions and the reliability and security of suppl y in 
France and for neighbouring countries . The IEA considers the  impact assessment of future 
demand/supply trends, to be performed by the government under the  pluriannual energy 
programming  (PPE), as crucial in this context . 
First, security of electricity  supply and reliability need to be ensured at a time of outages or 
suspension of plants for maintenance. Noting that hydropower was  contributing 10% of 
the electricity generation in 2015 with not much more to be expected  in the future, and 
that the recours e to more fossil fuels is not in line with low- carbon objectives, it means 
that non-hydro resources (wind and solar power, waste, biomass and biogas ) would need 
to substitute for at least the 28% of reduced nuclear contribution by 2025, a significant 
increase from their current share of 6.8% in 2015. The objective of “50% nuclear in 2025” 
of the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act is only possible if there is a very high level of 
confidence that the alternative low- carbon means of generating electricity, mainly from 
variable renewable sources , will be available in that time frame, providing the same level 
of quality and reliability of supply, and at acceptable costs for the consumers and 
taxpayers. And, given the lower availability of the intermittent renewable sources, a simple 
substitution in terms of capacity is not sufficient.

178 Second, the feasibility needs to be further analysed on the basis of cost comparisons, 
which take into account the cost o f renewables versus nuclear LTO for 20 years. For 
nuclear in particular, the option to drastically reduce the load factor on a large number of 
plants, instead of closing a number of them, would seriously impact the cost of the generated electricity.  
Third,  the 50% by 2025 requires EDF, as an industrial actor, to revise its refurbishment and 
safety upgrades programme. The Grand Car énage  programme has never been conceived 
and organised on a global fleet basis and could be launched in steps through several 
investment projects. However, this programme should be optimised with all aspects of 
economy of scale and best use of manpower and resources.  
Fourth, the shutdown of a large number of reactors over a short period of time c ould have 
negative impacts from an industrial policy perspective, which has historically been a major 
element of the French integrated nuclear policy (reactors and fuel cycle with reprocessing 
and currently the use of recycled materials as MOX fuel in the 900  MW
e plants), unless 
appropriat e decisions are taken to minimis e those impacts (such as speeding up the use of 
MOX fuel in the rest of the fleet).  
Fifth, the impact on the decommissioning and long -term waste management policy needs 
to be considered. Preparations will have to be pursued ac tively from the safety, technical, 
industrial and financial perspectives. Ensuring the proper funding is particularly important. Concerning waste management, it is also important to keep the pace in developing the 
long- term solution via geological disposal . Funding for decommissioning and waste 
management is set aside during the operation period of the plants. The shutdown policy, in application of the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, has therefore an impact on 
these important issues.    
Implementing  the Act targets with flexibility in time would allow France to develop a 
strong low -carbon energy policy based on sound economic, technical and industrial 
perspectives, including in the nuclear field, at a time when, in other parts of the world, 
nuclear programmes are developing fast. In this context, it seems therefore reasonable to 
apply the 50% nuclear “rule” with some “flexibility in time”, and provide clarity in the pluriannual energy programming schemes while integrating also a potential for export.  
In conclusion, while the 50% objective could be kept, its application should be moved 
beyond 2025, at a time to be determined, taking full consideration of the real evolution of 
the demand and export potential, and the real deployment of alternative low- carbon 
sources of electricity. The cap at 63.2 GW
e could be kept over time for the whole period 
and serve as the upper limit until the 50% are reached. A possible way forward could be to 
target the 50% share for around 2035. Between now and then, G eneratio n II plants could 
undergo LTO programmes for 10 or 20 years and be further operated, as approved by the Safety Authority, and then be replaced by the Generation III plants so as to keep up to 50% 
nuclear -generated electricity, depending on  the evolution of  electricity demand. This way 
forward ensures continuity with a recommendation given in the 2009  in-depth review, 
while also respecting the spirit of the Act .  
  
The energy and climate goals of the Act will require the national energy RD&D strategy and 
funding to be properly aligned, an intention which has been set out also in the Act . A key 
stated goal is a reduction in the share of electricity generat ed from nuclear power from 
78% at present to 50% by 2025. The RD&D strategy will have to reflect the new s trategic 
needs of the nuclear fleet, notably safety, decommissioning, waste management and new 
builds. The short - to medium -term research on the existing reactors will mainly be

179 financed by industry, in particular to reduce the costs of construction and ge neration, and 
to maintain  the highest safety levels. Given the goal of achieving a 40% share of electricity 
generat ed from renewable sources  by 2030, it will also become important to increase the 
flexibility of the nuclear fleet and adapt its operation to more variable and uncertain 
electricity supply from variable renewable sources. Next to large reactors, France should 
also research the potential for s mall and medium reactors, in step with global 
developments. Indeed, these reactors may show flexibility to adapt to the evolution of the 
electricity grid, contribute to co- generation and other non- electric applications, and be 
more easily financed because of  their lower total capital investment and their shorter 
construction time.  
In the longer term, Gen IV fast neutron reactors will make better use of uranium resources and may burn highly  radioactive waste, reducing the lifetime and radiotoxicity of high -level 
nuclear waste, into an integrated closed fuel cycle approach. ASTRID , coupled with 
corresponding cl osed fuel cycle technologies, becomes a necessary element to 
demonstrate the technical and industrial feasibility of the technology, as well as its safety. 
Only via this demonstration phase will the technology become commercially available in 
the longer term for integration in the nuclear fleet (2050 and beyond). ASTRID is critical for maintaining the competence, skills and leadership of the French nuclear sector in this advanced nuclear domain and for  allowing its participation in international co -operation 
programmes. It is therefore necessary to continue all efforts to build the demonstrator by the 2030 horizon.  
RECOMMENDATIONS  
The government of France should: 
 When implementing the target of reducing the share of nuclear to 50%  in the mix,  
assess  possible  changes in energy demand and supply  through the PPE,  with a view 
to guarantee continuous security of electricity supply and maintain the low -carbon 
footprint. Take into account safety and economic aspects when deciding on the LTO 
of France’s Generation II  plants and new build Generation III plants.  
 Ensure that the French nuclear industry is able to face the challenges ahead, 
including the LTO and new build programmes and their impact on the interconnected EU electricity market, and the role of the French nuclear sector on the international 
scene.  
 Ensure timely management of high -level nuclear waste, in particular geological 
disposal, moving from research to design, authorisation and licensing, and construction of the facility, by involving all stakeholders . 
 Continue to closely monitor and further develop the funding mechanisms for 
decom missioning and waste management  to ensure the availability of the necessary 
funds when the time come s. 
 In the area of nuclear RD&D, continue activities on safety and competitiveness of 
large water -cooled reactors, and engage in research on s mall and medium reactors, 
and, for the longer term, keep pace with the design and construction of the ASTRID 
industrial demonstrat ion reactor  and the associated research on the closed fuel 
cycle.

Key data  (2014) 
Government spending on energy R D&D:  EUR 1 054.3  million  
Share of GDP : 0.49  units of GDP per EUR 1 000  
RD&D per capita: EUR 15.9  
OVERVIEW 
The total government spending on energy research, development and demonstration 
(RD&D ) of France  has remained stable since 2011 . In 2014, the  French government spent 
EUR 1 054.3  million  on energy RD&D.  
The set of technology priorities  has changed significantly since 2007 , as France has 
sought to diversify its R&D p ortfolio beyond nuclear energy. Still today, nuclear RD&D 
holds the lions share, but other priorities, including smart grids and renewable energy 
are increasingly attractive for French industry and public research and development entities. 
Fundamental research is carried out by a highly diverse range of institutions , 
complemented by the flagship Investment for the Programme for Investment in the 
Future (Programme d ’investissements d ’avenir, PIA ), a multi -stakeholder programme 
designed to establish close links with industrial and commercial actors and to accelerate 
the deployment of innovative energy technologies.  
Research in France operates throughout the whole value chain, and includes 
fundamental research carried out by public laboratories, industrial research by 
industrial/ commercial institution s as well as pre -production trials and demonstration 
projects in partnership with public laboratories and industrial companies.   
France is preparing an energy RD&D strategy for the energy transition  to green growth.  
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEW ORK  
As part of t he reforms under the 2005 POPE Law , France largely divided the funding and 
execution of RD&D activities into separate institutions.  The reforms also saw the 
creation of new organisations and processes to improve co -ordination between research 
agencies and to increase the efficiency of the use of RD&D funds.   
Funds for RD&D are mainly channelled through fundamental research agencies, the 
Environment and Energy Management Agency  (ADEME ), the Alternative Energies and 
Atomic Energy Commission  (CEA)  and the Public Investment Bank  (Banque publique 
d’investissements, BP I) under the supervision of the relevant ministerial departments.

182 The National Research Agency (Agence Nationale de la Recherche , ANR ), established in 
2007, provides financing for basic RD&D in science and technology. ANR also aims to 
improve collaboration between public research institutions and industrial actors. Out of 
a total budget of  EUR 575 million  in 2014, around EUR 70 million was allocated to 
research activities related to the energy sector. New energy technologies include renewable energy, CO
2 capture, energy storage, energy networks , hydrogen and fuel 
cells.  
The Environment and Energy Management Agency  (Agence de l’environnement et de la 
maîtrise de l’énergie, ADEME)  is the public body implementing for industrial 
development, focusing on renewable energy sources, heat, waste,  energy efficiency, 
storage and smart grids. ADEME administers a range of demonstration funds and calls for specific projects, including the Heat and Waste Funds. As part of its remit, it produces 
roadmaps for energy technology RD&D that feed into the RD&D policy -making process.  
The Public Investment Bank (Banque publique d’Investissement France, BPI France) is 
responsible for a range of RD&D funding streams. It manages the Single Interministerial 
Fund (Fonds unique interminist ériel, FUI),  with allocations by relevant ministerial 
departments, support , together with regional funds,  collaborative R&D projects for 
products or services in the final stages of the innovation cycle. In 2014, 132 projects 
received EUR 177.7 million from the F und.  
France has several public research institutions with a commercial activity, such as cEA, 
the Centre scientifique et technique du bâtiment (CSTB), the Institut français des sciences 
et technologies des transports, de l'aménagement et des réseaux (IFSTTAR) and the  
Institut français du pétrole énergies n ouvelles ( IFPEN ) for industrial research and 
demonstration; and, at the implementation stage , the se institutions work wit h private 
industry. 
The French  Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (Commissariat à 
l’énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives, CEA ) has been the historic hub for RD&D 
activities in nuclear energy.  The CEA aims to keep France as an international leader in 
atomic energy technology, from new materials, novel reactor designs, safety, 
decommissioning and waste management, to the co -ordinat ion of major international 
nuclear fusion power initiatives. The CEA is also a major RD&D actor in new energy 
technologies such as solar, fuel cells, hydrogen, energy efficiency and storage. The CEA energy research budget is approximately EUR 750 million
1, representing around 95% of 
all public nuclear energy research.   
The French Petroleum Institute  New Energies (Institut français du pétrole énergies 
nouvelle s, IFPEN)  is an independent research institute focusing on industrial 
development, education and training. It works on  technologies for  low-carbon transport 
and energy -efficient vehicles, biofuels, hydrogen and other low -carbon energy sources . 
Its budget has been gradually increasing to reach EUR 132 million in 2014.  
The main institutions  carrying out basic research along the energy RD&D value chain 
include the CNRS (Centre  National de Recherche Scientifique) , institutions and 
universities; the CEA and  IFPEN for indu strial research and demonstration; and the 
initiatives planned  and supported under the PIA.

184 PROGRAMMES AND FUNDI NG 
The Programme for Investment in the Future  (PIA, Programme d’ investissements 
d’avenir) is the key  initiative to accelerate deployment of new energy technologies. It 
focuses on the stages of the innovation chain closest to market implementation, and its 
funding programme also includes technologies beyond the energy sector. With a 
EUR 5.5 billion alloca tion to the energy sector over the period of 2010 -17, its 
programmes are  implemented through eight key initiatives (Figure 11.1). The PIA 
operates through a combination of grants and financial t ools, such as repayable advance 
loans or investments in equity.  
Half the funds are allocate d to ADEME in two initiatives. The first is  the demonstra tion 
project  for the environmental and energy transition,  started in 2015 with two 
components: a EUR  1.7 billion allocation for direct financing of demonstration projects in 
the areas of renewable energy, smart grids and storage, energy efficiency and building s 
renovation; and a  second EUR 1.15  billion programme dedicated to future 
transportation, focusing on vehicles (e.g. low- consumption cars thanks to more efficient 
engines, auxiliary services and others ) and to associated infrastructure, such as  funding 
local authorities ’ plans to roll out charging points for electric vehicles .  
A second flagship initiative in the PIA is the creation of the Institut pour la t ransition 
énergétique ( ITE). The programme is administered  by the ANR and aims to create 
internationally relevant technology innovation campuses in the field of renewable 
energy, new energy technologies and energy efficien cy. The aim of the ITE is to build the 
future foundation of energy RD&D and its activities are to be  aligned with the future 
SNRE.

A final key component of the PIA is the  Industrial Projects of the future (PIAVE) initiative, 
co-ordinated by BPI France (Banque publique d'investissement ) which started in 2015. 
Targeted areas are aligned with the 34 plans under the  new national industrial 
reindustralisation and development policy, the  New Industrial France (Nouvelle France 
Industrielle ), which was  launched in 2013, with a  focus on projects not receiving  other 
public funds.

185 Overall public expenditure on RD&D in France amounted  to 2.29% of GDP, 16% above 
the IEA average, while public expenditure on energy RD&D reached EUR 1 054.3  million  
in 2014, the latest available data. France has the highest nuclear RD&D  among IEA 
coun tries as a share of GDP. Energy RD&D expenditure increased by  an annual  12%  since 
2011, thanks to higher energy efficiency funding, but subsequently decreased in 2014 to 
reach 2009 levels.

PRIVATE SECTOR 
France’s energy industry is a leading sector in energy RD&D investment.  In total, EDF, 
ENGIE and AREVA dedicate around  EUR 1 billion per year to R& D in low- carbon 
technologies. The French s tate has significant shareholdings in the sector.  0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.4Share of GDP (spending per 1 000 GDP units)Nuclear

186 EDF accounts for 40% of EU- wide spending of all energy utilities on R&D (ESMT 
Innovation Index). In 2016, EDF opened its R&D Lab in Paris -Saclay, with around 1000 
staff. Paris -Saclay is the research and innovation cluster  that  account s for 20% of 
French R&D expenditure.  
According to  the State Shareholding Agency ( Agen ce des participations de l’État, APE),  
EDF had a budget of about EUR 440 million per year , mainly focused on nuclear 
(France, U nited Kingdom ) and intelligent grids, energy efficiency and electric vehicles 
as well as renewable energies.  The R&D budget of ENGIE for low carbon technologies 
amounted to EUR 200 million per year along three key priorities (low- carbon power 
generation, intelligent energy management, notably in cities , and the natural gas 
supply chain of the future). The R&D budget of AREVA was EUR 231 million in 2014 
and EUR 273 million in 2013. Table 11.1 illustrates the position of the French energy business in the latest available 
global ranking of the EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard which ranks the world

PRIORITIES  
France has a long -standing goal of achieving RD&D investment parity between nuclear 
and other new energy technologies. While an equal share has not yet been reached, the 
technology mix has changed significantly. Fossil fuel RD&D funding has decreased by 
30% since 2009, as funding has been redirected towards low -carbon technologies. In 
particular, funding for renewable energy technology RD&D has increased by 50% over the last six years. Biomass technologies account for over half RD&D  on renewable 
energy .  
Reflecting the strategic priorities of the French electricity industry, public research funding on future electricity grids has grown threefold since 2009. Progress towards the 
long- term strategy of rebalancing RD&D priorities in favour of other low -carbon 
technologies beyond nuclear R&D is ongoing. The new SNRE is to  address the energy -
specific challenges raised in the previous strategy (SNR ), notably multi- scale governance

contributing to the co -ordination of public research efforts to develop low -carbon 
technolo gies.

ASSESSMENT  
The energy RD&D framework in France is based on the 2007 energy RD&D strategy and 
the Grenelle Environment I and II Acts . A new energy strategy for RD&D (SNRE) is 
currently being prepared by the two ministries in charge of energy and of research , and 
is to be adopted by end of 2016.  
The National Strategy for RD&D  was introduced in March 2015, setting several priorities 
and directions with  ten research challenges, among which ‘” clean, safe and efficient 
energy” , and five key areas that should be part of the forth coming strategy: multi -scale 
governance of energy sy stems; dynamic management of energy systems; energy 
efficiency; reduced needs for strategic materials; and decarbonisation of the energy and 
chemistry sectors. These challenges reflect the needs for both the direction and the 
stated targets in the Energy Transition  for Green Growth Act, and the competitive 
advantages of French industrial and RD&D institutions.  The Act specifies th at the  
national strategy  is to be drafted in accordance with the pluriannual energy 
programm ing (PPE)  process and the n ational low-carbon s trategy. Drafting the SNRE , 
starting in 2016, implied a large consultation with the relevant stakeholders, in particular 
ANCRE and ADEME. A ccording to a  second specification of the Act,  the new strategy is to

189 be developed in collaboration with local governments  so as to address the multi-faceted 
governance of the energy system. The specific articulation of this requirement is yet to 
be determined.   
The Energy Transition for Green Growth  Act require s that the new National Energy 
RD&D Strategy and its funding be properly aligned with the energy and climate goals , a 
key goal being the reduction in the share of electricity genera ted from nuclear power. 
The RD&D strategy will reflect the future  needs f or the nuclear fleet, notably safety, 
decommissioning, waste management and new builds. The short - to medium -term 
research on the existing reactors will be financed mainly by industry, in particular to 
reduce the costs of construction and generation, and to maintain the highest safety 
levels.  
Given the goal of achieving a 40% share of electricity generated from renewables  by 
2030, it will also be important to increase the flexibility of the nuclear fleet and adapt its 
operation to variable and uncertain electricity supply from intermittent renewable 
sources. Next to large reactors, France should also research the potential for s mall and 
medium reactors, in step with global developments with a view towards export 
opportunities. Indeed, these smaller reactors may show flexibility to adapt to the 
evolution of the electricity grid, contribute to co -generation and other non-electric 
applications, and be more affordable owing  to their lower total capital investment and 
their shorter construction time.  
Finally, France will pursue its R&D efforts to develop Generation IV reactor designs with 
the ASTRID demonstration reactor programme  and associated research on the closed 
fuel cycle. It is envisaged to construct a 600 MW e prototype of a commercial series of 
sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFR) which are likely to be deployed as from about 2050.  
Funding priorities and levels have remained stable since 2009, with a slight peak in 2011 
thanks to higher energy efficiency investment s. The  diversification of RD&D funding 
sources and technology  areas achieved since 2007 is good, even if nuclear energy still  
dominates public energy RD&D expenditure . While the goal of full parity in the RD&D 
budget between nuclear and new energy technologies is  yet to be reached, France is 
emerging as a world leader in smart grid and system integration technologies.  
The ambitious target in the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act of reaching a 40% 
share of renewable energies in the generation mix should be complemented by further 
efforts in the technologies and strategies that afford a low -cost integration of wind and 
solar power.  
Smart grid technology is a focus area of France, r anking first in an analysis by the 
European Commission’s Joint Research Centre. France has several advanced 
demonstration projects, and has designated some regions to develop high scale pilot 
projects (for instance SMILE in Bretagne -Pays de Loire and FLEXGR ID in PACA region in 
the south -east of France ). The new Industrial Plan for Smart Grids dedicates 
EUR 200 million to these projects (contributions from network operators, PIA, local 
authorities, etc.). France is well placed to innovate in areas that can support its energy 
transition. RD&D priorities on technology solutions to increase flexibility of power 
systems are welcome, in particular power- to-gas and other demand-response 
technologies. The public RD&D budget for storage technologies is a fundamental pill ar 
which should be strengthened for a widespread deployment that may not be adequately addressed by the private sector.

193 ANNEX A: ORGANISATION OF THE REVIEW  
REVIEW CRITERIA  
The Shared Goals, which were adopted by the IEA Ministers at their 4 June 1993 meeting 
in Paris, provide the evaluation criteria for the in -depth reviews  conducted by the IEA. 
The Shared Goals  are presented in Annex C.  
REVIEW TEAM  
The review team  visited France from 19 to 23 October 2015 . The team met with

1. Biofuels and waste comprises solid biofuels, liquid biofuels, biogases, industrial 
waste and municipal waste. Data are often based on partial surveys and may not be comparable between countries.  
2. Other includes tide, wave and ambient heat used in heat pumps.  
3. In addition to coal, oil, natural gas and electricity, total net imports also include peat, biofuels and waste and trade of heat.  
4. Excludes international marine bunkers and international aviation bunkers.  
5. Total supply of electricity represents net trade. A negative number in the share of 
TPES indica tes that exports are greater than imports.  
6. Industry includes non -energy use.  
7. Other includes residential, commercial and public services, agriculture/forestry, fishing and other non-specified. 
8. Inputs to electricity generation include inputs to electricity, CHP and heat plants. 
Output refers only to electricity generation.  
9. Losses arising in the production of electricity and heat at main activity producer utilities and autoproducers. For non- fossil -fuel electricity generation, theoretical 
losses are shown base d on plant efficiencies of approximately 33% for nuclear and 
solar thermal, 10% for geothermal and 100% for hydro, wind and solar photovoltaic.  
10. Data on “losses” for forecast years often include large statistical differences covering 
differences between expected supply and demand and mostly do not reflect real 
expectations on transformation gains and losses.  
11. Toe per thousand US dollars at 2010 prices and exchange rates.  
12. “CO
2 emissions from fuel combustion” have been estimated using the IPCC Tier I 
Sectoral Approach from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. In accordance with the IPCC 
methodology, emissions from international marine and aviation bunkers are not 
included in national totals. Projected emissions for oil and gas are derived by calculating the ratio of emissions to energy use for 2013 and applying this factor to 
forecast energy supply. Projected emissions for coal are based on product -specific 
supply projections and are calculated using the IPCC/OECD emission factors and 
methodology.

203 ANNEX C: INTERNATIONAL ENERGY  AGENCY “SHARED GOALS ” 
The member countries* of the International Energy Agency (IEA) seek to create conditions 
in which the energy sectors of their economies can make the fullest possible contribution  
to sustainable economic development and to the well -being of their people and of the 
environment. In formulating energy policies, the establishment of free  and open markets 
is a fundamental point of departure, though energy security and environmental protection 
need to be given particular emphasis by governments. IEA countries recognise the 
significance of increasing global interdependence in energy. They therefore seek to promote the effective operation of international energy markets and encourage dialogue  
with all participants. In order to secure their objectives, member countries therefore aim to create a policy framework consistent with the following goa ls: 
1. Diversity, efficiency and flexibility within the energy sector are basic conditions for 
longer -term energy security: the fuels used within and across sectors and the sources of 
those fuels should be as diverse as practicable. Non -fossil fuels, parti cularly nuclear and 
hydro power, make a substantial contribution to the energy supply diversity of IEA countries as a group.  
2. Energy systems should have the ability to respond promptly and flexibly to energy 
emergencies. In some cases this requires collective mechanisms and action: IEA countries 
co-operate through the Agency in responding jointly to oil supply emergencies.  
3. The environmentally sustainable provision and use of energy  are central to the 
achievement of these shared goals. Decision- makers s hould seek to minimise the adverse 
environmental impacts of energy activities, just as environmental decisions should take 
account of the energy consequences. Government interventions should respect the 
Polluter Pays Principle where practicable.  
4. More environmentally acceptable energy sources  need to be encouraged and 
developed. Clean and efficient use of fossil fuels is essential. The development of economic non- fossil sources is also a priority. A number of IEA member countries wish to 
retain and improve the nuclear option for the future, at the highest available safety standards, because nuclear energy does not emit carbon dioxide. Renewable sources will also have an increasingly important contribution to make.  
5. Improved energy efficiency can promote both environmental protection and energy 
security in a cost -effective manner. There are significant opportunities for greater energy 
efficiency at all stages of the energy cycle from production to consumption. Strong efforts by governments and all energy users are needed to realise these opportunities.  
6. Continued research, development and market deployment of new and improved 
energy technologies make a critical contribution to achieving the objectives outlined above. Energy technology policies should comp lement broader energy policies. International  
co-operation in the development and dissemination of energy technologies, including 
industry participation and co -operation with non -member countries, should be encouraged.

FranceEnergy Policies of IEA Countries
France has a significantly low-carbon electricity mix, owing to the 
key role of nuclear energy. However, much of France’s nuclear fleet is 
reaching the end of its lifetime. Against this background, France has 
started an ambitious energy transition: it is a world leader in designing 
a governance framework with a national low-carbon strategy, carbon 
budgets, a carbon price trajectory and plans for energy investment. 
France plans to reduce the share of nuclear to 50% in the electricity 
mix by 2025. While some nuclear reactors may continue long-term 
operation under safe conditions, maintaining security of supply and 
a low-carbon footprint while reducing nuclear energy will require 
investments in renewable energy and efficiency. The 2016 IEA review 
of France’s energy policies highlights these and several other areas 
that are critical to the success of the energy transition. For example, 
planned growth of the share of electric vehicles and variable 
renewable electricity will require enhanced power system operation 
and flexibility, including demand-side response, smart grids and 
metering, and more interconnections. 
The financing of this transition depends upon continued carbon 
price signals, increasingly open markets, competition, and consumer 
empowerment in gas and electricity retail markets.
This review analyses the energy policy challenges facing France and 
provides recommendations for further policy improvements. It is 
intended to help guide the country towards a more secure, sustainable 
and affordable energy future.
