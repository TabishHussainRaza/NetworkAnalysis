Two-thirds of Australians refuse to pay more for nuclear: new research






The Australia Institute surveyed a nationally representative sample of 1,005 Australians about their willingness to pay for nuclear energy.
 The results show that most Australians are not prepared to pay anything extra to have nuclear power in the mix.
Key Findings

Two in three Australians (65%) are not prepared to pay anything extra to have nuclear power in the mix.
Only one in 20 Australians (4%) are prepared to pay more than $500 per year to have nuclear power in the mix.
One in five Australians (19%) are prepared to pay up to $250 (13%) or up to $500 per year (6%) to have nuclear power in the mix.
Across the four large states, between 61% and 69% of residents are not prepared to pay anything extra to have nuclear power in the mix.
Most Australians are not prepared to pay anything extra to have nuclear power in the mix, regardless of voting intention.

End the gas industry’s free ride
Around 80% of Australia’s gas is exported overseas. Our research shows the gas corporations have paid ZERO royalties on over half (56%) of all gas exports. In fact, the government collects more revenue from HECS than it does from the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax.
 Chip in today and fund the research to ensure the gas industry pays its fair share.
